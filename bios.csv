name,bio
4080,"The existence of this God and the Forgotten Laboratory are linked to the
technology developed at Ubi Concordia. In fact, he is the youngest God in
existence, and still knows practically nothing about Rodia or the world in
general. He is able to understand human emotions even if he does not feel
them, but it is difficult for him, so he often asks if he has made a mistake when
it comes to evaluating them. He is not hostile to outsiders, but he does not
understand why they seem to enjoy killing each other, as he does not see the
point of risking something so fleeting and fragile in that way for a few coins.
"
8004,"B004 is the only creature R080 has created. Its initial purpose was to help him
gather information about the world, but now that he has dealt with some
mortals, the God of Science is making a great effort to implement a
mechanism that allows B004 to understand the emotions of living beings at a
higher speed. His success is, at the moment, very questionable, since B004
tends to assume that everyone feels an uncontrollable emotional maelstrom all
the time and does not stop constantly asking the people it meets if they are
feeling okay.
"
Aaxer Apocalypse,"When Torun gave life to the first Giant, he showed it to Vulcanar, trying to
impress him. The God of Fire did not waste any time getting to work on his own
creations, completely disregarding Yseros's advice.

The Aaxer Apocalypse shakes its three heads unpredictably, fooling its
enemies into believing a peck is coming, but instead dealing a crushing blow
with the shell in the back of its neck.
"
Abacus Mimic,"Tired of his students using an abacus behind his back to solve exercises in
class, a math teacher decided to take desperate measures by contacting
someone versed in the art of magic. His salary, unfortunately, did not allow him
to hire the services of an expert, so he decided to search the underworld until
he found someone. After a long haggling session, a price was agreed upon,
and two weeks later that Mage handed the professor a box. He was satisfied,
and opened it in the middle of class with the intention of scaring his students,
saying 'This is what happens when you use an abacus too much, so be
caAAAAAARGH!' The Abacus turned out to be more aggressive and vastly
more dangerous than anticipated, and amid the laughter of his students, the
teacher ran out the door with the Abacus chasing behind him.
"
Abaddon Guard,"Taylor created the Torture Chamber to punish all criminals, no matter what
they had done. After his death, a law was enacted to close the facilities.
However, Tartarith then left the Torture Chamber and began killing the
inhabitants of the city, so its use was legalized again.

In the darkness, the Abaddon Guard's armor emits a powerful greenish glow,
and the white parts of its shield shine, giving the impression that a skull is
floating in the air.
"
Abomination Brute,"Abominations are a result of Tartarith's actions in the Torture Chamber. To
create them, he overfeeds an individual for weeks, and then implants a second
head on their shoulder.

The Abomination Brute is the only one of its kind that is prone to violence, as
well as the only one who is good at it. It lets its enemies get as close as
possible by holding back, then grabs them by the arms and rips them off with
its brutal strength.
"
Abomination Volatile,"Tartarith created the Abominations to protect the Torture Chamber, but he
eventually decided that it would be more fun to set them free and let them sow
chaos in Rodia. However, when they do not feel the presence of the God of
Punishment, most Abominations disobey his orders.

The Abomination Volatile despises violence, and it prefers to grab its enemies
and throw them far away so that they stop hurting it. Naturally, this has ended
many lives.
"
Abyss Banshee,"Banshees are mysterious creatures that are as old as the world. Their
silhouette can sometimes be seen in the dark of night, completely motionless,
as if waiting for something.

The Abyss Banshee is feared by all Magi, as its screams consume the magical
energy that is necessary to cast spells. Moreover, prolonged exposure to the
screams can break magic items, rendering them unusable.
"
Abyssal Kraken,"Krakens are grotesque, ruthless creatures who avoid approaching dry land at
all costs. Most of them live in the depths and do not poke their heads out of the
water very often, while the Abyssal Kraken never does. Other Krakens consider
it an absolute sovereign, and only under its command are they able to carry out
joint attacks. Although in ancient times their strategies overwhelmed the
Revenants, nowadays the Abyssal Kraken's main task is help as many
Krakens as possible to survive when one of their nests is discovered.
"
Abyssal Spectre,"During the Unification War, there was a dark lord who surpassed all others in
power and evil. Sigmund the Eternal managed to deceive Vertraag to learn the
secrets of time, then betrayed him. Or at least he thought he had when he rose
up in arms against those who only wanted peace.

Stillborn babies become Abyssal Spectres after they are buried, and they are
able to consume the life energy of those they touch.
"
Abyssal Wisp,"Staring intently at a Wisp allows one to see the moment of their own death for
a few seconds. Whether they are truly fate or just the mast likely future, these
visions can be deadly on their own, often provoking heart attacks.

The Abyssal Wisp usually dwells in dark marine environments. Its eyes not
only allow it to see in the dark, but they can also move freely within its body,
allowing it a full range of vision.
"
Accursed Pit Worm,"When the Valkyrie army approached the walls of Omnia, Sigmund thought it
was bait, meant to prevent his ships from attacking the bulk of the Unification
forces.

Anyone exposed to the aura of an Accursed Pit Worm will have horrible
nightmares and night terrors for one night. Their first appearance precedes the
establishment of the first kingdoms, and it is believed that their origin is related
to the Pit Worms that arrive in the Torture Chamber by mistake, tortured and
modified by Tartarith.
"
Accursed Warhog,"In the past, the Asura used Warhogs as frontline troops in their countless
battles.

An orc Mage came up with the brilliant idea of repurposing Warhog corpses for
battle. However, Accursed Warhogs have no interest in fighting, and need to be
thoroughly trained by giving them truffles, and only truffles, as a reward.
"
Ace Luckmantria,"The various ecosystems of Hutika are home to creatures like the Luckmantrias,
found nowhere else in the world. However, nature always finds a way — or a
Uralos who wanted to make some easy money loses sight of a box full of eggs
for a few seconds in one of the worst neighborhoods of Neralim.

Ace Luckmantrias can perfectly camouflage themselves in the fall, which is
why they sleep for a quarter of the year without needing to feed, so they can be
awake at all times during the other seasons.
"
Acedia Sin,"Thanks to the research that was done at the Refuge of the Magi, Zonte's team
discovered that there are other ways of creating these beings.

When the Acedia Sin is attacked, the feathers on its hands shine with a faint
blue glow, producing an unbearable drowsiness that severely weakens its
enemies. Idlers are its preferred target, and if it finds them asleep, it will place
its feathers on top of their bodies so that they never wake up again.
"
Acrova,"The mountains north of the kingdom of Ercath are infested with these
creatures. The cold and dry climate, the large population of pines and the
scarcity of predators for the Acrova are the biggest reasons. Indeed, these
creatures eat wood, and they don't need much to satisfy their hunger. If they
are in danger, they emit a scream inaudible to the human ear. Immediately, all
the Acrovas in the vicinity gather at that point to face the threat.
"
Adaxial,"Adaxial is Alexandria's right hand, in charge of creating Clockworks and
ensuring Damarel's machinery works properly. Alexandria spent forty years
designing and building this creature, and he is very proud of the result. Unlike
Clockworks, the sound of the gears turning inside Adaxial is imperceptible to
human ears. Adaxial is so attuned to the God of Falsity's realm that it can
detect any problems in its machinery in a sixty mile radius.
"
Addled Leper,"There is a rare disease in Rodia that only affects humans. It was first
discovered in Taylor's time. In its early stages, the disease manifests as painful
sores on the skin of the limbs.

The Addled Leper can sometimes be seen standing still, with its eyes fixed on
something. It could be a book, a meadow, or the full moon. For a few
moments, these sights bring back memories to its mind, and they remember
who they were.
"
Aegis Angel,"This is the ultimate Angel, the last defense against the darkness that almost
devoured the world thousands of years ago. However, it was not the only one.
Erebyss and Surathli joined forces to create an army of them for the purpose of
protecting the light. There were hundreds, but it was not enough. The darkness
attacked by surprise, too soon, and no God could help her. Everyone arrived
too late, save one, who stayed to watch as his plans were fulfilled.
"
Aen Rift Dancer,"Rift Dancers are believed to be from another world, having ended up in ours as
a result of an abuse of magic. Although they do not need to eat, they are
sometimes seen in abandoned temples, enveloping magical items with their
bodies.

Aen Rift Dancers often gather in hills far from the cities during clear nights, and
remain under the stars for hours, emitting a soft murmur as if they yearned for
their light.
"
Aeolian,"The God of Wind is the most devoted protector of nature. Like many other
Gods, he can see what is happening anywhere without being physically
present, but Aeolian enjoys traveling and rarely stays in the same place for
long. He often flies over the Unsullied Meadows, sometimes in the company of
Dragons, with one eye always on the grass and trees that extend into his realm
as far as the eye can see.
"
Aerum Rift Dancer,"Some people believe the existence of Rift Dancers is linked to the Gods' role in
the creation of this world, but the legendary Mage Milner, originally from
Vanelin, disproved this claim by finding a correlation between the number of
Rift Dancer appearances and the bloodiest battles in the Unification War.

Aerum Rift Dancers appear mostly in high mountains, looking for strong air
currents with which to travel from one peak to another, perhaps yearning for
some peculiarity of their place of origin.
"
Agor Apocalypse,"Vulcanar put a lot of effort into making the Apocalypses look imposing and
terrifying, hoping the Watchers would flee when they saw them. Although that
never happened, their help was invaluable during the war, as they were able to
attack several creatures at once and attract attention to themselves, thanks to
their size and appearance. They allowed the inhabitants of towns and cities to
escape to a safe place.
"
Ahnkol Tremor,"Nobody thought that unleashing magic without control could affect the world.
First was the Watcher War. The consequences of that event gave life to the
battlefield, to the land itself. To the Tremors.

The tentacles of an Ahnkol Tremor can extend up to sixteen feet away. During
battle, it uses them to entangle the arms of its enemies and stop their attacks.
"
Ahnok Tremor,"The body of a Tremor is home to numerous creatures, mainly insects. Birds
are commonly seen pecking at a Tremor in search of its guests.

The Ahnok Tremor can effortlessly move earth and rock with its mind. In battle,
it uses this power to create hands and tentacles that cling to the arms and legs
of its enemies and trap them. They often create stone walls in forests and
mountains to protect the animals from poachers.
"
Aja Birku,"Aja Birku, otherwise known by Radian scholars as The Puzzle Box, is one of
the few creatures that still perplexes even the most devoted of artificers.
According to legend, Aja Birku is the key to visiting parallel dimensions, as it
mysteriously appeared during the Watcher War. Seven centuries ago,
Helmholtz, a prestigious Mage, succeeded in extracting its core, a crystalline
stone he called the Crystal Eye. However, before he could uncover its secrets,
the city of Nex was besieged by Omnia's forces. The attack failed, but what
was their real goal? That night, the Crystal Eye was lost forever.
"
Akara,"This being is fascinated by the creatures that inhabit Rodia and the rest of the
world. Chances are, if it meets a stranger, it will want to have a long
conversation and bombard them with questions. The life of non-intelligent
animals is especially interesting to it and currently it is dedicated to traveling
through the different ecosystems outside the Land of Breath and Balance,
contemplating the varied and abundant wildlife that proliferates there. Unlike
Ariamaki, it does not care about balance and is of the opinion that this God
should take a break from his endless crusade.
"
Alakadan,"Alakadan is the eternal companion of Yllor, and both of them have guarded the
gates to the Refuge of the Magi side by side since its construction. When the
city of Vanelin was besieged in a conflict, they fought together with the Red Hat
order against the army of Siralim. The kingdom of Vanelin fell in the end, but
Alakadan and Yllor managed to escape and return to Zonte, only to discover
that their home had also been taken over by the ruler of Siralim. When Yllor
learned of this, Alakadan had to paralyze him with the poison of his sting to
prevent him from attacking without first assessing his possibilities. After
convincing him that his plan, or lack thereof, was suicide, they agreed to split
up to ask for help in liberating the different kingdoms and realms from the
tyranny of the invaders.
"
Alcazar,"AA Bastion that gives shelter to a person with royal blood becomes an Alcazar,
even if that person was an illegitimate child. This was discovered in the years
after the unification of Rodia by a famous scientist from a noble family who
studied Bastions for a long time. After several weeks of research, he went
inside a Bastion and the transformation happened. He replicated his
experiment seven times before formulating his hypothesis, although he did not
know whether this phenomenon can be triggered in other ways.
"
Alexandria,"Damarel is a realm full of steam-powered machinery that works with pinpoint
precision. Alexandria spends most of his time thinking about how to improve it
and ensuring it does not fail, but now that his realm has become accessible, his
focus is on outsiders. He is generally hostile to visitors, but if any of them help
protect his home, he wilk gladly reward their actions. The God of Falsity is
extremely literal, unable to understand metaphors or sarcasm. Indeed, talking
to him can be very dangerous unless words are measured correctly.
"
Alluring Snaptrap,"Years before weighing anchor at Rodia, the legendary pirate Willian James and
his crew managed to find an island of which only a few rumors existed. Eferia,
the indomitable jungle, inhabited by a single intelligent species, the Ak'haruts,
to which one of the Auditors’ agents, known as The Lost, belongs.

The substance released by the Alluring Snaptrap is extremely dangerous, as
the brain interprets its smell as that of something familiar, such as food or the
trace of a relative. Initially, it reproduced the scent of its victims’ favorite food,
but the adaptability arms race between predator and prey has brought them to
a point where Eferia's fauna follows the trail of any pleasant smell with much
caution, and Alluring Snaptraps hide among vegetation.
"
Amaranthine,"In the beginning, there were eleven. They shaped the world and created
everything that exists. Or, at least, that is what they believed. A blinding flash
illuminated the velvet of the night. Were the stars falling from the sky?

Despite the Amaranthine's disturbing appearance, it is as peaceful as the other
Amaranths, and it spends most of its time simply observing the landscape. If
attacked, this creature floats in the air and spins frantically to protect itself.
"
Amethyst Paragon,"Helmholtz discovered that the gem in the crown of a Paragon is the focus of its
aura, and their body loses all color if it is removed. However, the gem itself has
no power unless it is placed on their foreheads. After Helmholtz's fight with
Sigmund, the Amethyst Paragon asked him for its freedom, and he refused.
However, when the Unicorn Firewalker caught him by surprise and ended his
life, this creature managed to escape before Milner arrived to revive him with
her Undolim Seraph.
"
Amorphous Shambler,"William James and his crew visited hidden and forgotten places on the high
seas. Deep in the Boreal Ocean, where he and his people were cursed, he
discovered creatures who could not die. The waters were riddled with
amorphous beings capable of levitating in their unlife. At first, some of the
captain's crew thought they might be edible, but their rotten stench was
warning enough not to. Sea Shamblers are not aggressive creatures by nature,
but when the captain's ships sailed over shoals of these creatures, many were
hit hard, causing a fight in which no member of the crew lost their life.
"
Amphisbaena Arbitrator,"In the heyday of Omnian civilization, the capital's Institute of Magical Research,
under Sigmund's orders, brought to life extraordinary creatures named
Amphisbaena to improve the quality of life of the kingdom's inhabitants.

Some Amphisbaena were born with an innate ability to resolve conflicts. Their
greatest purpose is believed to have been to serve the kingdom for diplomatic
purposes, but there is no evidence to confirm this theory. Many became
psychologists at schools, large companies, unions or in their own offices.
However, the best known and most beloved of their community were the
Amphisbaena Arbitrators, thanks to their flawless performance and tireless fight
for their rights.
"
Amphisbaena Chef,"Amphisbaenas are creatures who can perform specific tasks flawlessly. They
are normally gentle, kind, and charming, and try to solve problems through
dialogue, keeping in mind other people's arguments and points of view.

Some Amphisbaenas were literally born to cook. They just need to test the
ingredients separately to know if combining them is a good idea. Today, this
knowledge is available to everyone, thanks to the numerous cookbooks that
have been published based on their discoveries.
"
Amphisbaena Gardener,"The Amphisbaenas' arrival was not welcomed by everyone in Omnia, as many
of them risked losing their jobs. One would think the Pilwiz would have felt
threatened as well, but this was never the case. In fact, Sigmund, aware of
what would happen if he tried to integrate these creatures into agricultural
activities, asked them to dedicate their efforts to other tasks. It was not until the
fall of Omnia that the Amphisbaena began to work the fields, but only in private
properties, or in regions the Pilwiz were unable to supply due to the distance or
weather conditions.
"
Amphisbaena Inspector,"Aiter a time, Amphisbaenas began to suffer persecution by the Omnians, who
sukjected them to extortion so they would abandon their work. It was not long
before the first corpse of an Amphisbaena appeared on the glass steps of the
capital, stabbed and bruised.

Some Amphisbaenas are highly insightful thanks to their analytical skills, and
they have become valuable assets in the security forces of Rodia's major cities.
But there are always exceptions. Following the fall of King Misery, a spike in
crime has occurred in much of the kingdom of Neralim, and authorities have
found that one of these creatures is at the head of the group responsible.
"
Amphisbaena Prospector,"The protests of the citizens of Omnia against the Amphisbaenas grew, and the
Amphisbaenas brought several unions to trial, accusing them of inciting crimes
against their species. Sigmund finally took sides, and decreed that continuing
the hunt of these creatures would be punished with exile to the Torture
Chamber, whatever the crime committed against them.

Amphisbaena Prospectors perform a wide variety of physical tasks, but they
are best known for mining inside the gigantic Nether Orb on which the capital of
Siralim was built, with the aim of extracting the raw material used to make Spell
Gems. Due to the power it contains, most creatures eventually become ill, but
Amphisbaenas are immune ta this influence thanks to their biology.
"
Amphisbaena Vaccinator,"Adter the fall of Omnia, the surviving Amphisbaenas scattered across the newly
founded country of Radia, trying to find a place in society. At first, they ran into
the same difficulties they had found in Omnia, but over the years their
presence was normalized. Today, these creatures are treated with respect and
equality, and measures for their protection are no longer necessary.

Amphisbaena Vaccinators can move any substance they ingest into an okject
with which they are in contact. In the case of vaccines, they can generate up to
ten additional doses of it after it has entered their body.
"
Ancestral Phoenix,"When they reach a certain age, Phoenixes can decide to burst into flames.
They emerge from the ashes as chicks that retain the memories of their
previous life.

The Ancestral Phoenix has direct control over the lives of other creatures. For a
brief moment, it can transfer its ability to resurrect through any of its spells.
Centuries ago, a famous Mage caught one of these creatures in an attempt to
resurrect her lover. However, its ability, like many others, only works for the
recently deceased.
"
Ancient Arachnalisk,"The Ancient Arachnalisk owes its name to the fact that it usually lives in ancient
temples and cities, forgotten places that have been uninhabited for centuries. It
knows every inch of its home and expertly plays with lights and shadows,
making its web undetectable for most. It is also able to pinpoint the precise
location of its prey and even assess its strength based on the intensity of the
pulls.
"
Ancient Automaton,"Two years ago, a group of explorers from Neralim found a set of unfinished
prototypes in the ruins of Omnia, in the basement of what used to be a
research center.

The Ancient Automaton is the mast faithful to the original design. Before
entering battle, it bangs its shield with its spear. If either of them break, it
produces a replacement, which comes out of its mouth in a matter of minutes.
"
Ancient Ent,"Human activity, especially during wars, has caused serious damage to the
world's forests. After the Forest Priests first appeared, some Magi realized that
magic could affect nature, and even allow them to use nature in their favor.
Thus, the first Nature Magi were born.

Ancient Ents are usually harmless, but they can be merciless when their forest
is threatened, especially by humans, whom they sometimes impale on the
branch of a tree as a warning to others.
"
Ancient Grimoire,"Although the Refuge of the Magi was the mast prestigious magic tower in the
time of the first kingdoms, there were others in which successful experiments
were carried out.

When the Ancient Grimoire spends a long time on its own, encased between
two books on a bookshelf, it starts singing. The melody of its voice attracts the
unwary, whose soul is separated from their body the moment they open it due
to the power it contains.
"
Ancient Spirit,"The existence of the Spirits is sukject to the use of magic and a series of
conditions that vary according to the subspecies. They are usually merciful
creatures who take care of any beings they encounter, but their lack of
intelligence can sometimes lead them to support evil causes.

When a Spirit has lived for five hundred years it becomes an Ancient Spirit.
Thanks to its experience, it has a vast knowledge of magic and many spells
that manifest spontaneously when someone tries to save an ally.
"
Ancient Yeti,"There is a legend in Sithicus about a gigantic Yeti that appeases the most
violent snowstorms, though some believe it is just a Winter Aspect, and that the
furious gales of snow are actually a product of the Ancient Yeti's will. While it is
true that it can channel the cold of the frozen mountains, its only concern
nowadays is to eliminate the ruler of Siralim to prevent its home from being
destroyed. As a precaution, it has decided to kill any Mage who crosses its path.
"
Andolin Seraph,"Seraphs were Surathli's gift to humanity for having managed to establish
kingdoms in which to live in peace and harmony after centuries of endless wars.

Despite its majestic appearance, the Andolin Seraph is a joker who likes to
make those around it laugh, although it sometimes goes too far with its antics.
It likes to play with its enemies, provoking them and then deftly dodging their
attacks to make them waste time.
"
Angel Bat,"This creature sleeps at night and goes hunting when the sunlight begins to
appear on the horizon. It usually inhabits cold places and migrates when the
warm season arrives, if the temperature is not low enough for snow, as they
sleep and nest in rocky crags covered with snow to hide from predators, only
sticking their heads out.
"
Angel Soulslayer,"The Angels were created by the deities of light at the time when humans were
taking their first steps in the world. They were the first warriors and fought
against a dark power that threatened all existence at the dawn of creation.

The Angel Soulslayer is able to snatch the soul of its opponent for a few
minutes, causing a feeling of emptiness and depersonalization that has led
many of its opponents to commit suicide.
"
Angelic Voidlord,"A long time ago, there was a woman whose ideas greatly influenced how
society would develop. In her youth, she met Dragan, a student of magic who
years later would become the mast prominent figure in the Refuge of the Magi.

The Angel Voidlord gives off an aura that attracts anyone nearby. Despite its
sinister appearance, many people do not take the necessary precautions when
approaching it, and the creature takes advantage of this to grab them tightly.
Unfortunately, anything that comes in contact with a Voidlord for over ten
seconds ceases to exist in an instant, without leaving a single atom behind.
"
Anguish Banshee,"Banshees are considered to be emissaries of death. Although they are seldom
seen, they sometimes appear near a dying person and emit a spectral scream.

Whenever a catastrophe occurs, the Anguish Banshee approaches the
traumatized survivors and places a hand on their hair to feed on their pain.
"
Animatus,"Rodia has definitely earned its reputation for being a country riddled with
curses. Mausoleums, mage towers, haunted forests, cursed weapons of all
kinds... Indeed, Sigmund even saw to it that there was a curse affecting the
entire country. Some years ago, the head of the department of Curses and
Counter-Curses of the Magic University of Siralim began to thoroughly study
Helmholtz's monograph on the creation of the Golems. After decades of
research, he found a way to build a devastating Golem using cursed items and
materials, extracted from different curse-laden places in Rodia. Replicating his
feat is not an easy task, but a Mage of great knowledge and talent has recently
succeeded. The Animatus can absorb and harness the strength of its allies and
become much more dangerous... at a price. Any creature affected by this
ability feels its own strength being taken away, as if part of their being had been
removed. Although the effect is temporary, many creatures who fight alongside
the Animatus start feeling disgusted by it, hating it, or even fearing its very
presence.
"
Anneltha,"A truly ancient being who has not been seen for milennia, precious little
knowledge has survived over the ages regarding Anneltha. Fragments of
ancient texts preserved in the libraries of Undolim, treated as unverified myth,
speak of a colossal worm Goddess who banished the sentient races of what is
now Radia from her realm for the crime of disrespecting the earth with their
greed. Only Aeolian has been known to speak of her, and then only reluctantly,
with noticeable sadness.

The recent machinations of Caliban have, however, unsealed her realm - and
Anneltha has not seen fit to re-seal it to outsiders once more. Few adventurers
have chanced the Forbidden Depths thus far, but reports of a crystalline hive
swarming with brutal monsters, as well as a few distant sightings of Anneltha
herself moving about the realm, suggest that these deep caves and their
inhabitants have not suffered for their isolation from the world.
"
Annihilator Fiend,"At first glance, Fiends seem to be frightening and clumsy creatures. However,
they can travel at great speeds with precise jumps. In the blink of an eye, a
Fiend that looked to be far away could be devouring its prey.

The presence of an Annihilator Fiend affects the minds of the creatures around
it, eliminating any sense of calm to replace it with anger or hostility. The more
agitated a creature is, the more susceptible it becomes to these effects.
"
Apis Adolescent,"The Apis Adolescent owes its name to its lack of horns. However, it is similar in
size to the other Apis, which begin to grow horns immediately after birth. In the
past, it was able to channel the power of other Apis to increase their power over
the weather and the soil's fertility, helping them change whatever they wished.
At present, these creatures can turn certain spells into an energy blast that
deals massive damage to whoever cast them.
"
Apis Charger,"The Apis lived in the kingdom of Kaito since its establishment thousands of
years ago. They were considered heralds of the sun and fertility, but there were
never any temples in their honor. Today, they are loyal creatures willing to give
their own lives to protect their allies. The Apis Charger is not skilled in magic,
but it wears traditional armor with which it rams its enemies, dealing
devastating damage at the cost of receiving injuries from the recoil.
"
Apis Defender,"The Apis walked freely through the streets of the cities and towns of Kaito.
People fed these creatures regularly, and they were cared for whenever they
became ill.

When the blue protrusion between the horns of an Apis Defender begins to
glow softly, the wounds its allies would receive are transferred to this creature.
For this reason, the Apis Defender is commonly seen accompanying armies
and gangs of raiders, who sometimes abuse its extraordinary ability until it dies.
"
Apis Endurer,"At first, the Apis were gentle creatures that would never harm a living being. If
they were in danger, their only coping strategy was escaping.

As the Apis Endurer gets hurt, its skin becomes more and more resilient until
even the strength of a Giant fails to damage it. For this reason, many warriors
raise these creatures from a young age so that they can ride them when they
reach maturity.
"
Apis Guardian,"When the Watchers invaded Kaito, the Sphinxes tried desperately to defend
the empire. Their last attempt to repel the attack involved modifying the Apis so
that they could add their strength to the battle.

It is believed that Guardians can perceive the evil intentions of other creatures
through their eye of providence. Some kings believed this myth and welcomed
those they should not, as their eye only perceives such intentions when they
involve immediate violence.
"
Apis Majesty,"The Sphinx Usurper ordered all of the Apis in the empire to gather together
while it explored the pyramids of the ancient pharaohs with its followers to
recover the orbs with which they had been buried.

In the past, the Apis Majesty could concentrate to divert the light and the heat
of the sun over a certain region. They lost this ability during the Watcher
invasion, but in return they are now able to concentrate their energy between
their horns to increase their power.
"
Apis Protector,"The Apis used to have magic powers that influenced weather and fertility.
However, the Sphinx Usurper and its closest associates used the power of the
Nether Orbs to permanently alter their powers.

The protrusion between the horns of the Protector is sold at a high price as a
good-luck charm, as these creatures are immune to curses. The amulets,
however, lack this property.
"
Apis Warrior,"The Apis were turned into loyal beasts by the Sphinx Usurper, able to face
danger. In exchange, they lost their power over the earth and the sun.
However, adding the strength of the Apis to the battle against the Watchers
was not enough to change the fate of the empire. The Apis Warrior, made by
the Usurper to protect it, knew that it was fighting for a lost cause and rebelled
to free its people. The Apis turned against the Sphinxes, who could not prevent
their escape on the last day of Kaito.
"
Apocranox,"Elinar was a forest Elf who lived for hundreds of years in the northeast
Cutthroat Jungle of a different continent. In that place, an evil empress not only
banned non-humans from using what little magic there was, but also ordered
their extermination, which caused an exodus of creatures such as Smiths and
Gorgons. The Elves, hidden in the woods, were the main foes of this Dark
Lady, the only ones who were not exterminated despite the fact that they would
not leave their home under any circumstances. Elinar was their most powerful
warrior, but the Auditors tried to recruit him before the war came to an end.
Elinar accepted the offer, but he would only join them when the war ended. The
Auditors assured him that the land of the Elves could never fall to the empress,
and that she would be betrayed by one of her own in less than a year. Still
Elinar declined the offer. The next morning, the empress was dead. According
to one of the survivors in the castle, five Carnages and a ""big eye"" had taken
her down after overwhelming her personal guard. For the eleven years he
worked with his five companions in the organization, Elinar used the codename
Morning Star.
"
Apollinaire,"All Rift Dancers hate Magi, but Apollinaire especially so. In ancient times, this
creature attacked a tower inhabited by Magi and annihilated them all, leaving a
terrifying trail of blood and entrails in its ascent. It has been seen touching other
Rift Dancers, making them disappear with a peaceful sigh, as if it allowed them
to return to their own world.
"
Aquamarine Carbuncle,"Carbuncles are elusive, easily frightened creatures, though not by nature. In
ancient times, humans discovered that the gem on their forehead has the
ability to store spells, which can then be used by anyone with practically no
limitations.

Any magic item around an Aquamarine Carbuncle gets slightly colder and
gives off specks of blue light that are more visible the closer the item is to the
creature. Unlike the rest of their kind, Aquamarine Carbuncles do not dislike
water and sometimes they even enjoy shaking themselves next to others of
their species while they are wet.
"
Arcana Chimera,"The Chimeras were created by T'mere M'rgo for the sole purpose of protecting
the Amalgam Gardens.

The Arcana Chimera is the most intelligent of its kind, although military strategy
is better suited to one of its siblings. It prefers not to fight physically, but when
cornered it uses its stinger to keep enemies away. Only if this does not work
will it lower its head and charge towards its enemies, possibly knocking them
out. In its spare time it loves to read, especially plays. Indeed, some these
creatures have recently visited Rodia's theaters.
"
Arcane Automaton,"Thanks to advances in magic, a group of Neralim scientisis succeeded in
creating a functional design of the unfinished prototype. Automatons were built
to protect Rodia. They are mindless soldiers who only obey orders from their
owners.

The Arcane Automaton is unable to handle weapons with its hands, but it can
telepathically move the crystals that orbit around it to cut its enemies down. If
one of the crystals breaks, it uses the tears that come from its eye to make
another.
"
Arcane Familiar,"Familiars love reading and studying magic, which is why it is rare to find one
that does not carry a book. They are expert Bat hunters, using their knowledge
about the emission and reception of ultrasounds to lead them to a trap.

If another creature chooses the Arcane Familiar as prey, it will defend itself by
hitting its enemy on the legs with its cane without causing unnecessary
damage.
"
Arcane Pilwiz,"The Pilwiz are a species that is exclusively devoted to agriculture, and
especially to the plantations of corn, of which they have complete monopoly in
every kingdom of Rodia.

The presence of the Arcane Pilwiz has become a vital part of the agricultural
cycle, as it can accelerate the growth of the plants around it. However, it must
sacrifice an animal daily to produce this effect.
"
Arcus Vulpes,"The Arcus Vulpes can change its fur color at will effortlessly. In this way, it can
camouflage itself in all kinds of environments. However, it is also a skilled,
energetic, and tenacious hunter, so it generally does not use its camouflage
unless it is feeling too lazy to chase prey at that moment.
"
Ariamaki,"Nobody knows for sure when or how Ariamaki appeared, as his realm was
discovered by the Magic University of Neralim a few months ago. For the God
of Balance, good and evil, and chaos and order must coexist for the world to
function properly. However, his attempts to create balance are not always very
successful, and he sometimes ends up helping to commit real atrocities that he
later deeply regrets. Also, his way of dealing with people is chaotic, as he
refuses to be nice as well as unfriendly to the same person all the time.
"
Armored Maniac,"Maniacs are creatures that live in a small peninsula surrounded by an almost
impassable desert beyond Ahruna.

The Armored Maniac is nothing more than a Maniac Builder trained to
demolish the wooden walls of neighboring tribes. Before going into battle, it
wallows in a pool of mud and blood, preferably from its enemies.
"
Ascendant Revenant,"Ascendant Revenants never use melee weapons in battle. They are great
engineers who learned to use gunpowder in a continent far from Radia, as well
as a real pain in the neck for the authorities. Although, luckily, they are few in
number, these creatures cause so much damage that those who live to tell the
tale always describe it as ""unfair."" Their enemies either explode or are cut
down by the Revenant's companions while trying to tear the devices from their
bodies. After the war ends, Rodia's council will make it a top priority to find a
way to reduce the damage these contraptions cause in battle.
"
Asclepias Fae,"In the middle of the desert known as the Bronze Sea, there is a huge, lush tree
that is not affected by the extreme temperatures in its environment. It is known
as Yataka.

The Asclepias Fae, like many of its kind, leaves behind it a trail in the color of
its wings while flying. However, this Fae can use that trail to distract its enemies
by creating a whirlwind of color as it flutters at high speed, confusing them or
even hiding its presence.
"
Ashbone Efreet,"Immediately after the Djinn uprising, Vulcanar visited Zonte and his teacher to
propose a deal. Apparently, seeing a Djinn Pyromancer had given him an idea.
In exchange for his help to take back to Refuge of the Magi, they would help
him create the Efreets. As long as there is a fire, the Ashbone Efreet can alter
its movement and duration at will. If it sees a fire break out, it will use its
powers to prevent anyone from extinguishing it.
"
Ashmouth Cerberus,"The Cerberus species was created by Vulcanar to terrorize the inhabitants of
Rodia and protect the entrance to the Great Pandemonium.

When prey is not readily available, the Ashmouth Cerberus will sate its hunger
with any embers it can find around it. It is used to enduring temperatures above
200 °F, but it can survive in colder environments thanks to the thickness of its
skin and the heat it gives off due to its metabolism.
"
Ashskin Spellmane,"Spellmanes are ferocious, solitary creatures who inhabit very diverse
ecosystems in Rodia. Only during mating season and gestation can two
creatures of this species coexist.

Vulcanar believes the Ashskins give the Great Pandemonium a homely,
welcoming feel. He recommends approaching these creatures calmly,
unarmed if possible, to pet and play with them, as, according to him, they are
tame and friendly with visitors.
"
Ashwood Ent,"The Nature Magi, alarmed by the progressive deterioration of the forests,
decided to animate the strongest trees to preserve the ecosystem. They raised
their roots, shook their branches and finally were able to walk on the
deteriorated land that needed their protection.

Ashwood Ents are rarely aggressive, and often walk through the forest looking
for injured animals to help them.
"
Aspect of Change,"This creature's presence ensures the gestation cycle of the other aspects
remains active. In addition, it is capable of altering the weather, turning even a
light drizzle into hail. It was created thousands of years ago by six powerful
Nature Magi when the increased use of magic began to affect the cycle of the
seasons. That is why Aspects are destined to confront any spellcasters they
come across.
"
Aspect of Decay,"Egas the Necromancer once corrupted some Aspects with his power so they
would fight in his army during the Unification War. However, once Egas was
defeated, they dispersed. They live in places where the land is sterile and the
seasons never seem to alter the climate or the ecosystem much. Some
travelers fear these creatures and run away from their terrifying appearance,
but they are not aggressive creatures.
"
Aspect of Seasons,"The purpose of this creature is to ensure that the rest of the Aspects do the
jobs for which they are regularly created, but its main concern in recent
centuries has been to protect them from those who sometimes attack them out
of fear or unfounded hate. Unlike the other seasonal Aspects, it uses lethal
force against anyone who opposes its mission. Moreover, its powers can bring
balance to any and all seasonal adversities.
"
Aspect of Time,"It appears mysteriously in Rodia to witness events of historical significance and
to ensure the flow of time is not disrupted. It was created in the past by Milner
and Helmholtz after the ravages of the Unification War, when several temporal
anomalies manifested in the form of rifts. When one such rift appears, the
Aspect of Time instantaneously appears to close it with a wave of its hand.
"
Aspen Ent,"The Aspen Ent is always accompanied by the unmistakable sound of the birds
nesting in its head. Although it respects the cycle of life, it does not allow
predators to feed on its guests. Many animals fear it for this reason, although
this creature never goes beyond scaring them.
"
Assault Griffon,"Griffons protect the Azure Dream, and there is always a legion of them flying
over the clouds in search of intruders. During mating season, their flocks gather
in the air and can even block out the sun across a wide area.

Although their ability to wield weapons cannot be compared to that of a human,
Assault Griffons can inflict great damage by charging at their enemies with
great speed, passing them by without exposing themselves to a counterattack.
"
Astro Construct,"Constructs need sunlight in order to move. They have batteries inside them
that gather this energy, but this is not an efficient way of recharging them
during the rainy seasons or in places where the sky is often cloudy. In response
to this, several alternatives have been devised: buying pre-charged batteries,
recharging the batteries with spells, and the Astro Construct. This creature is
constantly receiving energy, not only from the sun, but also from the stars and
the moon, thanks to its much more powerful light receptors. Because this
cutting-edge technology requires the use of one Nether Orb for every one
hundred receptors, its price is simply astronomical.
"
Asura Blooddrinker,"The Asura are an ancient tribe that lives and dies in battle. These creatures
shook the foundations of human civilization a thousand years after the Watcher
War.

Before entering battle, Asura Blooddrinkers perform a ritual that culminates
with the sacrifice of a creature. For the next twenty-four hours, anyone who was
present in the ritual can regenerate their wounds by feeding on the blood of
their enemies.
"
Asura Bonebreaker,"The Asura conquered a large number of human settlements in what would later
be known as Rodia. Fearful of being next, the inhabitants of the surrounding
towns and cities began to organize themselves.

Asura Bonebreakers are spiritual leaders who constantly remind their people of
the meaning of their existence. They are loyal to Gonfurian, who grants them
the power to help their allies in battle.
"
Asura Fleshstomper,"But reconquering their towns was not enough for the humans. They entered the
lands of the Asura to eliminate them once and for all. Their civilization was
turned to ash, and they have lived in small tribes since then, earning their living
as mercenaries, hunters, thieves and raiders. The one in charge of dispensing
torture in the new Asura ""empire"" is the Fleshstomper. When a slave tries to
rebel, this creature makes an example of them so that the others never think
about it again.
"
Asura Gutslasher,"It is obvious that the Asura are physically superior to humans. In addition to
their six arms and their incredible strength, they have a strong constitution that
allows them to withstand extreme temperatures.

The size of the knives of an Asura Gutslasher exceeds that of human swords.
They generally use one of them to distract their enemies until they find an
opening. Then, they stab their enemies in the stomach, inflicting wounds from
which it is difficult to recover.
"
Asura Heartripper,"The conquest of the Asura took place during an extremely cold winter. Humans
sometimes confused them with Yetis when they walked through a strong
blizzard, as both races can reach 9 feet in height.

Asura Heartrippers unleash a whirlwind of blows with their scythes and knives.
However, their blows are not very accurate.
"
Asura Strangler,"The Asura can expertly wield any kind of weapon with up to four of their six
arms. Handling so many sharp ends requires a lot of focus so as not to inflict
injuries to themselves in the middle of battle.

The Asura Strangler tries to get close to its opponents to immobilize them with
a rope, then deal the final blow with its maces.
"
Atlas Beacon,"The Beacons are fairies that protect a forest located in between four mountains
to the north of Siralim, making it difficult to access.

The wings of the Atlas Beacon are always engulfed in flames. However, the fire
this creature produces does not affect the fauna and flora of its habitat at all.
When it attacks, it spins on itself, turning into a deadly whirlwind of fire.
"
Augmented Ossein,"Osseins were created to annihilate any creature in their path. However,
Mortem's will prevents them from attacking the native species of the Titan's
Wound.

The Augmented Ossein was to be a winged creature at first, but Mortem
encountered serious difficulties in designing wings that would allow it to take
flight. However, its appendages now allow it to hang itself from high ceilings
and drop on its unsuspecting victims.
"
Aurum,"With the passage of ages, the cycle of life inexorably led to the natural deaths
of thousands and thousands of Carbuncles. When a Carbuncle dies, its body
becomes dust, but the gem on its forehead remains intact, retaining its power
for centuries. Most of these gems ended up becoming food for the Crunchers,
but many remained hidden. As if it were their fate, one by one they met and
merged until, two thousand years later, they became a self-aware being.
Aurum is faithfully devoted to order, and he loves feeling like the supreme
being of his own world. He is the manifestation of pure magic, and is not
affected by legends, hopes or faith. After the ruler of Siralim first met this God,
one of their advisors raised the possibility that Vertraag had planned the
existence of this deity from the beginning, since his mere presence seems to
have a crucial role in the stability of the world.
"
Autumn Aspect,"Sometimes, when the dry leaves are carried by the wind, they form a
copper-colored whirlwind that rustles violently. When it stops, a noble,
surly-looking creature can be seen. Like the other Aspects, they are considered
holy creatures by Nature Magi, though every Mage respects them to some
extent, as they are known to keep the balance between the seasons. If a region
does not wither as it should during the fall, this creature will accelerate the
process.
"
Avarita Sin,"Few are the creatures that came into being without the hand of man or God.
The Sins are among such exceptional cases, and their existence is linked to
the evil actions of the children of the Gods.

Many kings, queens and wealthy merchants have or had an Avaritia Sin at their
side. Sooner or later, their power falls by its own weight, their riches become
insignificant, and their life loses all meaning.
"
Avion,"Avion racing is common in Yarthe, a country where these creatures thrive.
However, trying to ride them without proper training is tantamount to suicide.
Their rider must care for them from the moment they hatch, or they will peck
and kick at anyone who tries to climb on top of them.
"
Azural,"Blizzards and frosts inspire fear and respect throughout the world. In the dawn
of civilization, humans began to worship a God who did not exist. They
implored him to placate the snowstorms and the cold, but their words were not
heard. However, after the Watcher War, magic was unleashed for the first time
on a scale that had never been seen before. And so, Azural opened his eyes
on top of a frozen mountain. He never helps with the cold, but he enjoys
watching travelers face its adversities.
"
Band Warchief,"Orcs are an intelligent species that is fully integrated into Rodian society
nowadays. However, some of them continue the way of life they once followed,
looting for survival or to amass wealth. A Band Warchiet is always at the head
of these groups, wielding his axes with ease, able to take down the entire guard
of a village singlehandedly if they are not prepared.
"
Barbed Warhog,"Warhogs are often used in the illegal creature fights that are held in the slums
of the big cities of Rodia, as well as in territories owned by crime syndicates.

The Barbed Warhog spends up to sixteen hours a day sleeping, hidden under
its spiky carapace. It usually inhabits places where it can easily camouflage
itself, and when it notices prey, it rolls into a ball to run over it from a higher
ground.
"
Bard Balladeer,"It is said that the Bards were born of songs and verses, of art and creativity.
The truth is that, to a certain extent, this statement is correct.

The Bard Balladeer's songs are full of love and tenderness. When two people
who are attracted to each other listen to this creature's music, they are
enraptured by an intense romantic feeling that pushes them to kiss.
"
Bard Caroller,"Many artists dedicate their lives to performing for the general public during
festivities. This forces them to keep traveling throughout the year, but they
return to their place of origin for the winter festival that commemorates the
victory against the Watchers. There they sing and dance with their relatives and
childhood friends, strengthening the bonds that unite them. When these artists
die during this period, a Bard Caroller is sometimes created. This creature's
music brings out existing emotions and positive thoughts, and it can even make
two people who hate each other hug.
"
Bard Fool,"Fools (as a trade) are common in the courts of monarchs. Bard Fools,
however, are quite rare. There was once a jester in Gangrel of great wit and
daring. His sharp and cunning tongue was unparalleled in court, but he became
seriously ill and was on the verge of death. The queen did not want to lose him,
and had some Magi find a way to save his life. And they did so, in their own
way. This creature makes people laugh like nobody else, but it also brings out
their flaws and their darkest secrets.
"
Bard Jongleur,"Bards are mute creatures, but they can activate the synapses of the brain of
the people around them to transmit their music.

In the festivals of some villages, a Bard Jongleur is released to tell stories to
the people. Although some Jongleurs have a great talent for music, the truth is
that the joy and fun that comes from listening to them are also the fruit of their
power.
"
Bard Minstrel,"Bards are the residual energy left behind when the soul of a literary artist or a
musician leaves its body for the afterlife. As with Shades, this does not always
happen.

The Bard Minstrel's harp is more an ornament than an instrument, but when
this creature runs its fingers through the ""strings"", it transmits soft melodies and
beautiful words to the minds of the people around it. Anyone nearby will feel the
imperative need to declare their love to their romantic interest.
"
Bard Poet,"For the soul of a literary artist or a musician to become a Bard, the presence of
magic around it is required.

The verses of the Bard Poet are sad and arouse melancholy in listeners.
However, its words suggest the transience of time and the futility of quarrels
and conflicts, especially among loved ones. As a result, many estranged
mothers, fathers and children reunite and solve their differences.
"
Bard Trovatore,"Bards long for the sounds of their ""voice"" to reach as many people as possible.
However, the effects of their music and their apparent inability to stop their own
mind-affecting traits have led many towns and cities to permanently ban these
creatures.

The songs of the Bard Trovatore ridicule politicians, sometimes with very
well-chosen words. Listening to them produces laughter, but also arouses
feelings of rebellion against authority.
"
Bard Versifier,"The wealthy people in the great cities generally have a Bard in their mansions,
who they keep in the basement until its presence is required.

The poems of the Bard Versifier speak of nature, of the singing of birds, green
on green, the wind whispering through the leaves of the trees. Its verses push
even the busiest people to abandon their chores and take a day off away from
the bustle of the city.
"
Bashloack,"Dark, humid places are these creatures’ favorites. They share nests with bats
and never feed on them, since they get rid of mosquitoes and other insects that
could transmit diseases to them. In return, they continually give off a mist that
makes it more difficult for these winged mammals to be preyed upon. When
faced with threats, they take flight as high as possible and plummet on their
would-be hunters to finish them off.
"
Bastion,"The Bastion was created by accident two hundred years ago by a group of
Magi when they tried to fortify the walls of a Rodian castle with spells. The lord
was impressed at first and wanted to add it to his guard, until he discovered
that the creature seemed intent on sheltering and protecting people. The Magi
were immediately expelled from his lands, but they took good note of what
happened and made sure that accident would not be forgotten.
"
Battle Clockwork,"The further one moves away from Radia, the harder it is to learn magic. In
places unable to rely so much on it, technology has developed further.

Battle Clockworks are the first to go on the attack when an outsider enters
Damarel. They are fierce warriors who will not listen to reason unless a
higher-ranking Clockwork (that is, any other Clockwork) or Alexandria himself
says otherwise. When they are not fighting, they come to a complete stop, and
the sound of the gears turning relentlessly within them can be heard.
"
Battrap,"Even though Eferia is part of Torun's realm, the Ak'haruts blocked access to it
through Teleportation Shrines and similar portals which adventurers and looters
have been using to travel for over a thousand years.

Snaptraps can uproot themselves and walk on their roots. Although they lack
intelligence, their ability to navigate their surroundings and respond to the
stimuli around them is impressive.

The Battrap is the only Snaptrap in Eferia that does not feed on birds,
mammals or reptiles, but on insects and feces. If another predator, including
other Snaptraps, tries to devour it or the animals it shelters, it will either attack
or flee depending on its chances.
"
Bejem,"These creatures can only be found in the wild in the kingdom of Ahruna. Their
multicolored shells attract many insects they feed on, so they never need to go
in search of prey. In addition, these creatures are capable of changing color at
will, so it is very easy for them to hide if someone tries to capture them. Over
time, they have learned to make their colors fade if they are caught, so they are
no longer attractive to those who would catch them to keep as pets.
"
Berserker Fiend,"The jaws of a Fiend are generally over 3 feet in length. Their bite is deadly to
most creatures, and even Apacalypses or Giants are at risk of losing a limb
due to their extraordinary strength.

Unlike the rest of its kind, the Berserker Fiend does not mind taking
unnecessary risks to obtain food. This creature attacks in a straight line with all
of its strength, trying to inflict as much damage as possible without worrying
about its own injuries.
"
Bestial Koloss,"These creatures produce physical puppets by outwardly prcjecting part of their
consciousness. Unless they feel threatened, these prcjections often look
harmless and can often be talked to as they leisurely walk through Sanctum
Umbra.

The Bestial Koloss is living proof that the fire of a Koloss Firebrand can be
extinguished. These creatures abused their power in the past and gave life to
other Koloss in search of admiration, but ended up paying dearly for it. Within
their societies, they are considered consummate egomaniacs, thus occupying
the last place in their hierarchy.
"
Bhasa Cherub,"The Cherubs are celestial beings that have long been a source of great
consternation to scholars of the arcane and divine. Numerous studies have
been attempted upon these creatures, but other than that they contain
tremendous amounts of magical energy, solid conclusions have been hard to
come by despite centuries of attempted studies.

The Bhasa Cherub always glows with a soft light at all times, but when it
considers itself imperiled it is capable of emitting an extreme amount of bright
light. The gleam is so bright it has been known to erode and bleach materials in
the area, burning the shadows of those surrounding it into the walls and ground.
"
Bile Abomination,"Tartarith sometimes gets distracted while creating Abominations, and the
sukjects end up dying or becoming creatures like the Bile Abomination. The
digestive system of this creature is a time bomb that never stops creating an
extremely corrosive substance in its stomach. Eventually, it exceeds the
capacity of its body and escapes through the mouth, seriously damaging
anyone it comes into contact with.
"
Bile Slime,"The Slimes suddenly appeared in the Refuge of the Magi, years after the Magi
began their experiments.

The Bile Slime has many eyes, but none of them are functional. It has a sixth
sense that allows it to occasionally predict its enemies’ movements and act
accordingly.
"
Bilemaw,"This monster lives in a desert northeast of Rodia called the Bronze Sea, which
is four times bigger than the country and separates it from the other nations of
the continent. The Bilemaw has a tail with markings in the shape of eyes, and
when confronted by anather of these creatures for its territory, it stretches the
skin around these markings as much as possible. Whoever has the smallest
eyes will leave the area without violence. In the event of a tie, each one will dig
a tunnel of approximately one mile in length and then have a race to decide the
winer.
"
Bio Bot,"Ubi Concordia, the hidden city from which the Auditors operate, is a utopia
where everyone can live in peace and harmony.

One of the most controversial scientific prcjects in Ubi Concordia aimed to
extend a creature's lifespan through technology and magic. The result was
disastrous, given the agony that living in a cold metal body meant for the
sukject, so it was abandoned until a terrorist group managed to get their hands
on the files. Today, Bio Bots are pawns who obey orders without question, on
the promise that they will be given back their old bodies if they do everything
they are told.
"
Bismuth Paragon,"This creature is the brightest of the Paragons, and the most ornate. This is
because it is greatly skilled at working all kinds of minerals, including the one
that is part of its body. However, it does not like working with small objects, and
is dedicated exclusively to directing or working on large constructions, many of
which have gone down in history for their size and beauty.
"
Black Crystal Smith,"Adter the second diaspora of the Smiths, some Gorgons decided to travel with
them to the Scarlet Mountains to settle there. The place is an inhospitable
wilderness, infested with aggressive creatures that prey on the unsuspecting,
so the Smiths were forced to specialize in the manufacture of traps to protect
their villages.

Black Crystal Smiths still forge some weapons and shields, with the only
purpose of attacking human knights and creatures.
"
Blademaster,"Brownies were once peaceful creatures that lived in human homes in exchange
for sharing certain tasks. This custom still exists in regions far from the big
cities, although it is unusual.

Blademasters are experienced warriors who came from abroad. In their country
of origin, they were fugitives who fought for freedom and protected their people
from slavers.
"
Blessed Chimera,"Chimeras are very different from each other, yet they all share a common
goal—to protect T'mere M'rgo's creations from the criminals who seek to
capture them.

The Blessed Chimera is so intense that its siblings often find it irritating. It
keeps talking about the importance of their mission until other Chimeras get
away from it, so Blessed Chimeras mostly interact among themselves. They
detest all intelligent creatures outside the Amalgam Gardens, as they believe
they would all plunder T'mere's realm if they were not so scared.
"
Blizzard,"These creatures only live in the high mountains where freezing winds blow
without pause. However, they travel to snow-covered towns and cities during
the winter and slide around the ground, leaving a trail of ice that Brownies and
children from many species use as a skating rink. They do not usually cause
problems, so adults let their children play with them, but they get restless if they
are forced to remain in a warm location, producing hail and cursing while
moving around in a frenzy.
"
Blobbarian,"Concoctions are relatively simple creatures whose purpose is to eliminate any
unauthorized lifteforms within the Caustic Reactor.

When a Blobbarian enters combat, the whole battlefield trembles in its wake —
or it would if this creature were made of solid matter. Regardless, a Blobbarian
never stops fighting, as if it were a reckless warrior who did not fear death. Of
course, unlike such a warrior, this creature does not fall dead when split into
two by a blade.
"
Blood Crusader,"Crusaders are warriors of light who have watched over the innocent from time
immemorial. However, their sense of justice is so extreme that they sometimes
end up serving morally dubious causes.

The Blood Crusader's color and abilities made it easy to give it a name. In the
past, it was believed that the blows of its mace only stole the blood of the
wicked. Today it is common knowledge that whether their target is a villain or a
hero matters little.
"
Blood Hound,"Hounds typically live in packs and develop elaborate strategies that never fail to
catch prey.

A drop of blood is enough for the Blood Hound to track its prey, no matter the
distance or the species it is following. When it finds its quarry, it does not
pounce on it without thinking, instead waiting for its pack to arrive and
assessing the situation before developing a strategy.
"
Blood Leper,"The Blood Leper is extremely dangerous, as the blood that emanates from its
body transmits the disease to humans who come into contact with it. It is
believed that this creature was once a Chosen of Gonfurian, which would
explain its longevity. It was caught near Crux centuries ago, and then studied at
the Magic University of Andolin. Now, the vaccine is cheaper and available to
everyone. However, this creature escaped after an old ruler of Siralim attacked
the kingdom, and now wanders the country.
"
Blood Reaper,"Reapers are as old as the first creatures the Gods created; beings that embody
the inexorable end of all things. They know the life expectancy of all creatures,
and Blood Reapers can even absorb their vitality when their scythe helps
accelerate the process. If someone touches the edge immediately after this
happens, they will rejuvenate several years, if only for a few minutes.
"
Blood Slime,"When the Slimes began to spread through the Refuge of the Magi, Zonte
decided to investigate the cause.

Blood Slimes leave behind a trail that often scares both humans and creatures.
Interestingly, these Slimes can't stand the sight of blood, and sometimes flee in
terror of their own trail when they turn around.
"
Bloodfang Gargoyle,"In the beginning, Gargoyles were just sculptures that adorned temples in the
big cities and served to drain their roofs. Nowadays, they are guardians of the
night that keep the citizens safe from evil creatures.

Bloodfang Gargoyles can change colors to look like ordinary sculptures. As the
inhabitants of Rodia have learned that not all carvings are what they seem,
many warriors have begun to destroy them preemptively, causing a great
damage to the country's cultural heritage.
"
Bloodmail Construct,"The average battery life of a Construct has been estimated to be 1000 days,
which is when the battery has lost too much charge and the creature stops
moving permanently. The batteries cannot be replaced, so the construct must
be discarded, although the material of which its body is made can be reused.

The Bloodmail Construct was created with the main purpose of preventing
civilians and soldiers from bleeding to death. At a touch of its armor, the blood
is partially returned to the circulatory system, giving the doctors more options to
save their life.
"
Bloodstone Cruncher,"When the Ravens created the Temple of Lies with Vertraag's help, no creature
except the Carbuncles inhabited its cold walls. But life, somehow, found a way.

The Bloodstone Cruncher's fangs are extraordinarily sharp and hard, capable
of piercing even stone. As their name suggests, their diet is strictly based on
the blood of other creatures, but they obtain more nutrients by eating a magic
item, or even better, a magical creature.
"
Bloody Eft,"Ordinary creatures who drink from the rivers of the Blood Grove or feed on the
fruits of this realm undergo drastic and permanent mutations within a few
minutes.

Eft hunting parties are always led by a Bloody Eft, or many of them. They are
generally in charge of scaring prey, driving them to a death trap, but when they
are the first to strike, their viciousness leads them to tear their prey to pieces.
"
Bloody Ossein,"The jaws of an Ossein are merely decorative, as they do not need to feed at all.
Early research on these creatures indicates that they are very similar to
Golems.

The Titan's blood is extremely hot, but this does not seem to affect the
Osseins, perhaps because they come from the same entity. The Bloody
Ossein was imbued with this blood at birth, which always remains in its body
thanks to the power of Mortem. This allows the creature to control other
Osseins and organize them for joint attacks.
"
Bone Hound,"On full moon nights, a howl can be heard. The sound of its voice is hollow, as if
the wind blew inside empty, lifeless spaces. The villagers barricade their doors
and windows. The Bone Hound has arrived. It is believed that its existence is
linked to humans, having come alive at some point to punish them for their
insolence. Followed by a pack as hungry for revenge as it is, the Bone Hound
bites and tears like the rest of its siblings. However, its fangs inflict wounds that
never heal.
"
Bone Reaper,"A Reaper sometimes appears when someone dies, remaining there for a
moment before disappearing. This led to the popular belief that these creatures
accompany the souls of the deceased to the afterlife.

During his stay in Eternity's End, Sigmund met and befriended a Bone Reaper.
This was an unprecedented event in history, and it led to the discovery that
anyone who wears a Reaper's tunic automatically knows the life expectancy of
any creature except their own.
"
Boulder Imler,"Both Imlers and Imlings belong to the same species, but this was only
discovered recently due to the considerable differences between the two.

Imlers develop protective feelings towards Imlings and do not let them come to
harm. Indeed, when a Boulder Imler egg is born as a Tainted Imling, its partner
takes care of it at all times despite its unbearable odor, embracing it at night
even though doing so leaves the Imler with severe skin injuries.
"
Bound Cerberus,"Vulcanar soon regretted creating this creature. Even the Elemental King
himself could not control it. In its first minutes of life it pounced on every
creature it could find and tore them apart with its jaws on its way to the surface,
where it continued the carnage. For several weeks it terrorized the people of
Rodia, until, in a stroke of luck for the country, it encountered the Eternal
Divinity. After a fierce battle, the Demigod vanquished the beast and left it
somewhere no one could find it.
"
Brain Animation,"Animations are the failed result of the necromantic practices of inexperienced
Magi.

The Brain Animation never attacks directly, instead using its powers to break

down the cells in their opponents’ bodies. If it is about to take damage, it uses
the same powers to harden its body and withstand blows that would normally
destroy it completely.
"
Brave Little Bot,"Though their methods are more than questionable, one of the Auditors’ goals is
to bring peace to the whole world.

Brave Little Bots are the last thing the Auditors would use when facing a threat.
They can perceive other creatures’ neural transmissions, as well as the
structure of their brains, analyze them with their extensive database, and use
the resulting information to know exactly what their target will do, all in a
fraction of a second. In addition, if they are lost and certain conditions are met,
they will self-destruct in a huge explosion.
"
Breathing Arbiter,"Arbiters have long stopped smelling, breathing, and thinking as they did before
transcending. The reason for their existence is linked to the Auditors, as they
themselves are the ones who decide who can become an Arbiter and who
cannot.

Only those who in life showed great leadership can become a Breathing
Arbiter. Its speech exudes charisma and causes admiration in those who listen
to it. In addition, they always lead groups of several Arbiters.
"
Brim Smith,"Like the Gorgons, the Smiths had to live in exile because of the genocide of
their species, decreed by a human empress in distant lands.

The Brim Smith links his immortal soul to his weapon, transferring part of his
power to his allies. If his weapon is destroyed, his soul is released from his
body, resulting in the Smith's death.
"
Brownie Brute,"Long ago, humans tried to enslave Brownies by taking advantage of their
altruistic nature. They made a big mistake. In Rodia, Brownies who have
learned to fight wield large hammers of different weights.

Brownie Brutes carry the heaviest ones, made of a hard alloy, and need to
undergo strict training before they can wield them. Despite their small size, the
strength of these creatures is immense, and they can easily handle weapons
that weigh up to twice their own weight.
"
Brownie Captain,"When humans began to capture, sell and enslave Brownies, all the strength of
their people fell upon them. They were small and fast, and they were many.

When a Brownie reaches a certain age, it usually has considerable combat
experience. These individuals are called Captains by their own kind, and they
are experts in finding enemy weak points at a glance during battle.
"
Brownie Enforcer,"Many humans took the Brownie's side during their rebellion. However, when
everything was over, most of these creatures left the cities, not wanting to have
anything to do with humans anymore.

Some Brownies work for crime syndicates, offering their services as hired
killers for a cheaper fee than the Nixes. Their small size is ideal for entering
homes and dealing with their targets without attracting attention, and they are
sometimes as efficient as the hired killers par excellence.
"
Brownie Loner,"Despite the rebellion’s success and the abolition of slavery, illegal Brownie
trafficking still exists. This despicable practice is persecuted by the authorities,
but that is not always enough. The Brownie Loner is a hero known among its
own people, a veteran warrior who secretly investigates these activities, goes
into the lairs of the criminals and defeats them with its bow. In cities such as
Nex and Vanelin, it is rewarded for its services, though it always shares the
money with the poor.
"
Brownie Mauler,"Brownies took their freedom by force, triggering a series of social changes in
human civilizations that ended with abolition of slavery in what would later be
known as Rodia.

Brownie Maulers are the most reckless in battle. Trained from a young age,
they handle the hammer with ease, spinning on themselves to hit several
enemies at the same time. Many of them come from families that were
affected by kidnapping and exploitation, and they have a deep resentment
toward humans.
"
Brownie Trickster,"It would take thousands of years for Brownies to reintegrate into human cities.
However, they no longer clean or cook for others, and they rely solely on
themselves. Although most of them have normal jobs in the city, some cthers,
like the Brownie Trickster, are involved in illegal activities such as robbery and
smuggling. They like to enter dens of ill repute and hit drunkards on their feet to
make them think it was someone else, starting a tavern brawl.
"
Bunny Devil,"These creatures approach human cities during the festivities with a single
purpose: to spoil everyone's joy. They are especially creative when it comes to
carrying out their perverse plans, deceiving everyone with clever disguises. Fed
up with their misdeeds, a powerful businessman from Siralim whose wedding
had been ruined by one of these Devils traveled to the Refuge of the Magi and
offered an exorbitant sum of money in exchange for a solution to the problem.
After some calculations, thirty-seven Magi from the Refuge traveled to Siralim
to visit the great Orb that lies beneath the city. There they carried out a
complex ritual that lasted for a week but was finally successful. The
appearance of all Bunny Devils became so ridiculous that it would be hard for
them to deceive anyone ever again.
"
Burhua Ophan,"The Ophans were born from the efforts of Surathli and Yseros to prevent their
creation from being destroyed.

The Burhua Ophan offers excellent support in battle. During the Watcher
incident, it helped Surathli's faithful cast more powerful spells. To produce this
effect, it rotates the ring around its body at high speeds, so that its magical
energy is shared with the spellcasters around it.
"
Caliban,"Legend has it that Caliban was born from Lister's dreams, but his nature is
nothing like that of his supposed creator. Unable to manifest himself in the real
world, this God began to appear in the dreams of influential people, aiming to
be worshipped, and to gain the power to escape the world of dreams. Caliban
feels so envious of the other Gads, he wishes to get rid of them at any cost,
and then take over Rodia and the rest of the world... or even destroy it. After
the war ended, Rodian scientists found that the remains of his body reacted
slightly in the presence of images of the Goddess of Darkness.
"
Cancerous Smog,"Adter the Unification War, hundreds of prisoners of war were transferred to a
complex located in the periphery of Siralim: the Spark plant.

In the short term, being exposed to the poison of the Cancerous Smog
produces beneficial effects for the organism. However, long-term exposure
causes tumors to grow in the body, and eventually results in death.
"
Canopy Arachnalisk,"The Canopy Arachnalisk is the most aggressive of its species, and it even tries
to ambush prey bigger than itself. Its web is not intricate and usually consists of
a single thread that goes around several trees on ground level and low
branches. This creature restlessly waits at the top waiting for a pull, at which
time it will fall on whatever touched the thread without stopping to assess its
chances.
"
Caritas Sanctus,"When the Sin cult was established, one of its youngest members rejected its
ideals and joined the Refuge of the Magi. There, Spielrein learned the secrets
of magic from Zonte's teacher.

Those who can never have enough wealth are targets for the Caritas Sanctus.
The hearts on its hands beat seven times, then the misers are overwhelmed by
the need to give away all of their possessions and live the rest of their life in
squalor.
"
Carnage Antagonizer,"After meeting with Yseros and the rest of the Gods who participated in the
Watcher War, Erebyss decided to set her Carnage prcject in motion, which she
had been thinking about for centuries. Their senses and their tracking skills are
unparalleled in this world.

The Carnage Antagonizer is a savage creature that kills its enemies in brutally
creative ways, to the point of instilling terror in the rest of its enemies.
"
Carnage Destructor,"The Carnages were born of the pain and darkness that Erebyss always carries
in her heart.

Any warrior who has fought a Carnage Destructor and lived to tell the tale
knows that letting them get close is a terrible idea. These creatures are capable
of attacking multiple targets at once by swinging their sharp tails while biting or
tearing at another opponent.
"
Carnage Devourer,"This creature is extremely intelligent, but despite its fierce appearance, it does
not have the unquenchable thirst for blood typical of its species. From a ruined
temple, the Devourer watched its allies fight each other. It quickly descended
and approached them, avoiding energy rays, spells and stomps. It climbed the
Mystical Giant's leg and jumped to its throat, making it howl and stop. The
Corox waited cautiously. Then, the Devourer turned to the Observer, who
wanted to ""tell"" them something.
"
Carnage Tormenter,"When Erebyss created the Carnages, she put special emphasis on making
them the perfect killing machines. They are agile and cunning, stealthy when
they want to be, and can end a person's life in just a moment.

Carnage Tormenters can smell fear, and they even take pleasure in the cries
and screams of their enemies. The truth is that they feed on negative emotions,
so they will prolong their prey's suffering as much as possible until they are
sated.
"
Carnivorous Inquisitor,"Apocranox was once a mighty warrior of the forests known as Elinar. The
Auditors were quick to recruit him and give him eternal life, just as they did with
the other five agents who were part of his group. He brought a large number of
Arachnalisks with him to the Blood Grove, and when they drank from its rivers
they changed and became the Inquisitors.

The Carnivorous Inquisitor uses its claws to tear apart its prey before eating it,
but is forbidden from using them to attack Ets, as they can easily slip away if
their tails are cut off.
"
Carrion Cockatrice,"Some believe that Cockatrices were born when reptiles or amphibians
incubated the eggs of other birds, but the truth is these are greatly adaptable
birds who very quickly evolved from a common ancestor.

Carrion Cackatrices live in arid environments inhabited by large creatures.
These Cockatrices have long stopped hunting, and now simply wait for one
beast to devour another, and eat what is left.
"
Carver Chopper,"The Carver Chopper is more a curse than a creature. It appears in the dreams
of those responsible for the death of many Carvers. At first it will make sporadic
appearances, observing its victim quietly from a distance, as if it were just a
part of the landscape that doesn't quite fit. With time, however, it will begin to
gradually approach its victim until it's close enough and the hunt begins. If it
butchers you with its merciless cleaver inside the dream, you will never wake
up.
"
Carver Heartseeker,"This creature prefers to travel in groups, keeping a low profile until one of its
teammates gets careless. After all, it doesn't care about anything other than the
heart beating inside, the only way to calm its cravings for blood... even if just for
a brief moment.
"
Carver Sadist,"This little fiend enjoys murdering creatures weaker than itself, especially if they
are helpless. Sometimes it travels with a group so that it can face more
powerful enemies, brandishing its two knives without concern for its
teammates’ safety. Do not expect an apology when the inevitable happens.
"
Carver Shadowstalker,"The Carver Shadowstalker is able to channel its magic into the weapons it
wields in order to inflict more damage to its enemies. Sometimes, one of these
fiends will approach a quiet village late at night and slaughter its residents,
house by house. It is believed that this is a kind of ritual that grants it strength
before facing a powerful foe.
"
Castitas Sanctus,"Aiter twenty years of research with Ainsworth, Spielrein left the Refuge of the
Magi, taking with her eight Nether Orbs with the help of ancther Mage.

There are many people in this world who let carnal desires control their lives.
Deception, theft and extortion are some of the tools employed by such people.
When the Castitas Sanctus's flower comes into contact with these individuals,
their libido is permanently replaced by nausea and vomiting.
"
Caustic Cerberus,"Cerberuses are aggressive and restless creatures by nature, but they can be
trained from a young age to obey orders and remain calm.

The Caustic Cerberus constantly oozes a corrosive liquid capable of burning
through steel. This is creature is especially dangerous to anyone nearby when
it runs or shakes itself, since the acid splashes everywhere and a single drop
can take out an eye.
"
Cave Cockatrice,"Cave Cockatrices are an Arachnalisk's greatest enemy, as no other creature
devours as many eggs from these arachnids. Since they generally inhabit dark
places such as caves or underground tunnels, they lost their sight in favor of
very acute senses of hearing and smell, as well as a sixth sense that allows
them to locate sources of heat around them through receptors on their
featherless skin. The council of Rodia legalized breeding these creatures to
eliminate Arachnalisk infestations.
"
Ceaseless Maker,"Like the other Demigods, it was born at the dawn of existence as an
experiment of the Gods, but it remained asleep until the lesser creatures
learned to use magic. The Ceaseless Maker is able to manipulate the
memories of others to carry out its desires without having to be directly
involved. To pass time, it writes plays and then implants the roles of the
characters in the minds of its subjects.
"
Celestial Idol,"Demigods are eccentric and whimsical, do not usually have much patience and
do not tolerate insolent behavior. The Celestial Idol likes to be constantly
worshipped, but it cannot stand the bustle of the city. It usually settles down in a
small town or a village and forces people to build a statue to which they must
pray daily, usually under the threat of raining fire from the sky if anyone does
not comply with its demands.
"
Celestial Occultist,"And the big day finally arrived. Everything was in place to start the process of
duplicating the Nether Orbs. Several rooms linked by endless spells, strange
liquids bubbling in cauldrons and test tubes, and hundreds of Magi arranged
throughout the Refuge, ready to do their part. Ainsworth was at point 0,
surrounded by nine Nether Orbs of great power. She grabbed her staff and
began the experiment. But something went wrong. Very wrong. The Nether
Orbs rose and a powerful magical current vibrated throughout the tower. A
tower whose space had been altered. The ritual disfigured her, stole her sanity
and turned her disciples into strange copies of herself.
"
Centaur Chaser,"Centaurs are very territorial and go to great lengths to protect their home, a city
built on top of a mountain which can only be accessed through a cave behind a
waterfall.

Centaur Chasers constantly watch the surroundings and chase away whoever
gets closer than they should to the entrance.
"
Centaur Duelist,"Its weapons may lack range, but its height and great dexterity give it an
advantage over its enemies. Centaurs currently seek to expand their domains,
and Duelists are part of their army's melee forces. They can sleep while
galloping, which is a big advantage when traveling long distances, allowing
them to catch the enemy by surprise when a battle is coming.
"
Centaur Khan,"The Centaur Khan carries the banner of its people. When a battle begins, it
sets it up like a spear and charges its enemies, striking powerful blows with the
stone-carved skull at the end of it. Sometimes, the wood that supports it ends
up breaking, but that does not prevent it from fighting with what is left of the
banner, or its fists, kicks, and shield.
"
Centaur Raider,"Wernicke the Raider is the most powerful Centaur warrior. Two hundred years
ago, when the Elves managed to find a way into his village, he tried to protect
his people armed only with a thick branch, but he was killed by the arrows of
his enemies. When everything seemed lost, his heart began to beat once again
in his chest. He had become Gonfurian's Chosen. Overflowing with new life,
and alone, he managed to contain the invaders until the other warriors came to
his aid.
"
Centaur Ranger,"Only the centaurs with the keenest eyesight can promote to the rank of Ranger.
This is largely due to the fact that this species has poor night vision, a big
disadvantage when their strategy requires them to gallop at night. Centaur
Rangers are able to interpret footprints and use them to estimate the direction
taken by the enemy, something that in many cases allows them to lay a perfect
ambush, shooting comfortably at their opponents from a safe distance.
"
Centaur Runner,"The tests to achieve the rank of Runner are so strenuous that many of the
Centaur candidates end up injured, never to gallop again. Centaur Runners can
hold their own in battle by using spells and shield slams, but their main purpose
is to look for supplies during long trips to feed the large Centaur parties.
"
Centaur Warrior,"Centaurs have been enemies with the Elves of the Cutthroat Jungle for
centuries, even before the Unification of Rodia.

Naturally, Warriors form the bulk of their armies, and though their training is not
as hard as that of the other ranks, they tend to be better prepared for battle, as
it is their only focus. Their marches are known to be extremely quiet, but that is
because most Centaurs take advantage of their ability to take a nap while
galloping.
"
Centaur Wrangler,"Like Duelists, their fighting style is not as rudimentary as that of the Warrior and
requires different skills. When a battle begins, Centaur Wranglers quickly
identify the most skilled warriors on the other side and disarm them with
precise snaps of their whips. They are in charge of keeping the rhythm of the
marches with cracks of their whips, to make sure the sleeping Centaurs keep
going in the same direction.
"
Cerberus Banelord,"The Cerberus Banelord gives off an aura that instills fear and sadness in any
weak-willed people near it. It is also one of the few intelligent Cerberuses, and it
has other creatures such as Carvers or Fiends under its command. It leads
them with an iron paw and makes them work in the mines of the Great
Pandemonium. After a workday, it usually sits in its den and reads some books
from the surface, accompanied by a servant whose job is to turn the pages.
"
Cerberus Gatewatcher,"Out of their three heads, only the middle one is sentient. ""After all, if all three
had to agree on where to move, at the end of the day they would only have
managed to pee themselves."" This is a quote by Dr. Fechner, a physiologist
who studied Cerberus brains for twenty-five years and discovered that the side
heads can only perform two actions: stare at whatever comes close and bite it
relentlessly.

Cerberus Gatewatchers, as their name implies, guard the entrance to the
Great Pandemonium.
"
Cerberus Hellguard,"Cerberus Hellguards are kept as pets by many lords of the Great
Pandemonium. Any subjects that have not been able to fulfill their obligations
become their food. Their jaws are capable of melting flesh because of the
creatures’ extremely high body temperature. They are also coveted by Rodia's
elite to guard their mansions, so small specimens that can be tamed are sold
at a high price.
"
Cerebral Vortex,"While Surathli was designing the Ophans, the Goddess of Illusion visited
Aeolian and helped him with his plans to help in the Watcher War.

The Cerebral Vortex is a modified nerve cell, and its role was to transmit
messages over long distances. It is able to acquire knowledge from any
creature and then grant it to another through a series of nerve impulses.
"
Chandra Cherub,"Cherubs are known on extremely rare occasions when exposed to specific
stimuli to initiate a rapid transformation, suddenly accumulating tremendous
amounts of energy before vanishing in a burst of intense light. To this date, this
has only been known to happen twice — once with a freezing cherub hewn of
ice, and with another sickly cherub perpetually enveloped in salty water.

The most volatile and mercurial of their kind, Chandra Cherubs often seem to
exist in synchronicity with unseen cycles and forces. Their energies change,
surging and waning, sometimes quite suddenly. While research into Cherubs is
already considered notoriously difficult, the Chandra Cherub's ceaseless
defiance of any known form of reason or reality is of infamous befuddlement to
Magi.
"
Chaos Guard,"Adter the Unification War, Rodia's council tackled the problem of the Torture
Chamber, resolving that only the cruelest criminals would be abandoned in the
facilities, regardless of where the crime took place, as long as it was inside the
territory of one of the unified kingdoms.

When a Chaos Doomguard finds victims, it slowly gives chase, guiding them
through the corridors until they reach a dead end where there is only a well.
The creature then raises its shield and pushes them inside.
"
Chaos Salamander,"A famous archaeologist recently found the mittens of a violent warrior from a
thousand years ago in the depths of the Cutthroat Jungle. To do so, she
ordered her Water Salamander to activate the powers of the artifact. The soul
of the warrior, trapped in the mittens, manifested and took over the creature's
body. The Salamander soon turned on its owner and ended her life. It then left
the ruined temple, looking for more adversaries to defeat.
"
Chaos Shapeshifter,"Shapeshifters live in small tribes, deep in the Swamplands and the Unsullied
Meadows. To protect themselves from their enemies, these creatures alter
their structure and copy that of other creatures.

Chaos Shapeshifters are the rowdiest of their kind. Some do not even choose
their path voluntarily, but they end up transforming into that class of creatures
simply because of their unbridled character.
"
Chaos Troll,"The Chaos Troll is always on the front lines, and before entering battle it
consumes a drug that inhibits pain and causes an uncontrollable state of anger.
Its body paint is not merely decorative, it is also used to warn other Trolls of its
presence, as it is likely to attack them as well after all enemies are gone.
"
Chillbreeze Yeti,"Yetis were created by Azural thousands of years ago, but their numbers have
been drastically reduced over the ages, especially due to hunting.

Chillbreeze Yetis dislike eating warm, freshly-caught prey. Before they put it in
their mouths, they first place it near a snowstorm to let it cool, and usually they
do not eat it until it looks like a block of ice and frost.
"
Chocolate Paragon,"These creatures owe their name to their uncanny resemblance to a chocolate
bar. Their history goes back to the Unification War, when Milner and Helmholtz
were preparing for the final battle. Many tests were needed before they
managed to create the unique Paragons they used against Sigmund. The
Chocolate Paragon was their last failed experiment before the Opal Paragon
was created, and the only one to survive the procedures of two of the greatest
Magi in history.
"
Chosen of the Fae,"When Shallan sensed an opening in the spell that prevented interdimensional
travel to her realm, she ordered the Fae to train the most skilled Braves,
creatures full of courage and adventurous spirit who are always accompanied
by one of the Fae. Their main mission would be to leave the Fae Lands and
travel the world in search of knowledge that could serve the Fae and all other
creatures within Yataka to protect themselves from the looters.
"
Cinder Devil,"The Cinder Devil likes to hide in dark neighborhoods and look for drunk people
who walk aimlessly at night. When it finds one, it stands behind them and
follows behind. Suddenly, its sword hits the ground and the blade begins to
crack the paving stones. The drunk person turns with a start and sees a figure
wrapped in darkness. Before they can think of what to do, the Cinder Devil
lights a fire in its right hand, and the slaughter begins.
"
Citadel,"Vulcanar himself created the Citadel as a mobile fortress. After asserting his
dominance over the Great Pandemonium, the God decided to get rid of his pet,
and he exiled it to a land that would eventually become Rodia. Wherever it
went it sowed chaos fueled by its frustration, until one day, out of boredom, it
decided to take a little nap that lasted until a recent incident involving Nether
Orbs woke it up. With renewed vigor, the Citadel is ready to vent its anger on
anyone it encounters.
"
Clairvoyant Spirit,"In Rodia's popular culture, Spirits are considered a good omen. These
creatures are apparently scared of the bustle of big cities, so it is more frequent
to find them at night in small towns or villages.

Many people suffer from the uncertainty of not knowing what tomorrow will
bring. Clairvoyant Spirits approach them and show them illusions of happiness.
These are commonly interpreted as visions of the future, and they help people
live without fear, even if they are false.
"
Clamorous Cockatrice,"Cockatrices are exotic birds that for centuries have inspired a multitude of
stories in the different cultures of Rodia, specially regarding their origin.

Clamorous Cockatrices had to survive in the Cutthroat Jungle. Imitating a wide
variety of sounds helps them drive away predators, attract prey, and trick other
creatures into hunting for them so they can eat both hunter and prey.
"
Clawing Cockatrice,"Of all the Cockatrices that exist today, the Clawing Cockatrice has changed the
least compared to its common ancestor. It continues to inhabit temperate
forests and mountains where it can hunt relatively effortlessly. Its most notable
adaptation is its webbed tail, which allows it to swim and dive at high speeds,
making it easier for it to catch river fish, a staple of its current diet.
"
Clawtail Wyrm,"In a very distant land lives a species of hominid dragons, who established their
reign there at the dawn of the world's history. They are powerful warriors, but of
simple ambitions, and have managed to repel attacks by armies of other
countries with resounding success, although given the extreme weather
conditions of their domains, they have never suffered a proper siege. However,
their strength resides in the creatures they host, tails that move independently,
but cooperatively. When a Clawtail Wyrm reaches adulthood, a ritual is
performed in which it is bound to one of these parasites for the rest of its life.
"
Cloth Abomination,"The life expectancy of an Abomination is usually under ten years due to their
poor state of health, which they do not notice because Tartarith removed their
ability to feel pain. On one occasion, a Bile Abomination vomited on another
that was still in progress. One would think the God of Torture would have left it
to die slowly, but he was feeling creative that day, so he fixed the damage.
Using pieces of cloth from here and there, Tartarith covered the corroded skin
of the creature, sewing them to its flesh with very clumsy technique. However,
the hands of a God had touched the rags and unknowingly imbued his creation
with extraordinary resilience.
"
Cloudskin Spellmane,"A Spellmane's subspecies does not depend on its parents, but on the
ecosystem in which it was gestated.

Cloudskins were the first Spellmanes, and they can usually be found in the
Azure Dream, their place of origin. It is very common for these creatures to
hide in the clouds, waiting for prey to get close enough. The humans of old,
back before they inhabited the world, developed creative strategies to avoid
their attacks and hunt them down with nets and rudimentary spears.
"
Club Luckmantria,"Luckmantrias have fascinated the Uraloses since the beginning of their
civilization, and there are all kinds of rites and traditions linked to these
creatures in their culture.

Treetops and tall grass are this creature's favorites. On one occasion, a Rodian
had a sudden cramp and fell to the ground in pain. Those who were traveling
with him stopped to help him, while a nearby Club Luckmantria opened its eyes
to find a horse's leg in front of it.
"
Coast Watcher,"Watchers appeared in this world for the first time after the humans started to
use magic in their wars.

This creature likes to go unnoticed near statues in temples, waiting for the
moment when someone notices its presence to attack. The Coast Watcher's
spells are more powerful when its opponent has little ability to cast them.
"
Colacanth,"Many are the ships that sail the world's seas, laden with magical items; but as
everyone knows, not all ships reach a sate harbor, or rather, any harbor at all.
A large number of these items end up littering the ocean floor, polluting the
waters around them. The Colacanth is a deep sea fish that suffered terrible
mutations when exposed to this phenomenon, altering its molecular structure
completely.
"
Cold Cockatrice,"In Radia, these creatures inhabit mainly snowy mountains and frozen places in
Azural's realm. This fact, coupled with their appearance, has led people to
believe their plumages evolved so they could camouflage themselves in their
environment and to protect them from the cold. However, Cockatrices with very
similar morphology but brown plumages also inhabit desertic regions in other
countries. A group of biologists from Andolin discovered not only that these
birds are identical, capable of withstanding extreme temperatures both high
and low, but also that their plumages change color in the following molt if their
environment changes.
"
Coldslam Yeti,"The Coldslam Yeti is one of Azural's own favorite works. Like the rest of the
Yetis, it prefers to live in high mountains covered with snow and ice, although
its thick fur allows it to adapt to almost any environment. These creatures can
summon blizzards when they get angry, and even turn summer into a terrible
winter for an entire city, which is why the authorities no longer allow them entry.
"
Colg,"This creature, also known as the dreamwalking pup, serves Caliban's purposes
as his loyal companion, according to those who have managed to survive its
attack. As Caliban normally cannot manifest in reality, he uses Colg to take
down whoever refuses to fulfill his designs. Fortunately, if one succeeds in
destroying this creature, Caliban will be unable to enter their dreams from then
on.
"
Colossal Giant,"Faced with the Watcher invasion, several Gods joined forces to prevent the
destruction of their creation.

The Giants were imbued with a natural instinct that drives them to carry big,
blunt okjects on their shoulders, which allowed them to crush the Watchers
when they sowed chaos in the first human cities. The Colossal Giant prefers to
wield columns from ruined temples, but it can also attack with the horn on its
head.
"
Conductive Carcharin,"The world's oceans are littered with magic items due to the shipwrecks that
have been happening since boats were invented. Many of them affected a
multitude of creatures, including sharks. Conductive Carcharins can summon
thunderstorms when many of them are gathered, so they can destroy even a
whale, or any ship that seeks to capture one of these creatures to sell its
valuable skin.
"
Consuming Vortex,"The Consuming Vortex tries to go unnoticed during battles, pretending to be a
spell that another creature cast. If it manages to reach an enemy, it will absorb
its life energy, creating a vortex of colors around it. If a spell hits its body, it can
absorb it temporarily and use it as its own.
"
Contagious Cockatrice,"Contagious Cockatrices had not been seen in the entire continent until they
arrived on board one of the ships of the infamous pirate William James. There
are numerous theories and stories about these creatures, including a small
rumor that claims they come from an unknown continent in which there is no
magic. In truth, a nuclear catastrophe filled that distant land with radiation,
allowing only the most resilient Cockatrices to survive. Contagious Cockatrices
are simply immune to nuclear radiation. James's pirates breed them as poultry,
as they are also docile and resistant to many illnesses, and they have begun to
commercialize them. Other ranchers, fearing competition, have taken
advantage of these creatures’ suspicious appearance to create a hoax, saying
they carry dangerous diseases.
"
Corox Apocalypse,"The Corox Apocalypse is a 35-foot long legendary creature, capable of piercing
the hardest skin and doing all those things gargantuan monsters with a
redundantly terrifying appearance usually do. The clash of titans between it and
the Mystical Giant was reducing the city to rubble while the Maluh Ophan and
the Watcher Sentinel fought their own battle. Punches, bites and headbutts
turned buildings to dust while the Ophan tried to fix the world. Until, finally, the
Carnage Devourer appeared.
"
Corrupted Phoenix,"Phoenixes are mystical creatures that can influence the life and death of other
beings.

During the Unification War, Egas the Necromancer corrupted a large number of
Phoenixes with a dark ritual to help him in his conquest. The presence of these
creatures prevented the resurrection attempts of enemy creatures. When
Helmholtz defeated the Necromancer, the Phoenixes escaped his control and
spread throughout the country. They are currently peaceful creatures that feed
on carrion.
"
Cosmic Giant,"Adter the first meeting of the Gods, Torun decided to show off his extraordinary
divine qualities by giving life to eight majestic and powerful creatures.

While designing the second of his creations, Aeolian flew over Torun's abode
and gave his own personal touch to the creature, as payback for his meddling
with the Untamed Vortex. Consequently, the Cosmic Giant's skin absorbs most
of the damage from attacks and spells thanks to its magical properties.
"
Cosmos Vulpes,"Unlike other Vulpes, this creature has not lost its animal instincts and can still
be seen stalking rabbits and small birds, although it does not need to feed on
them anymore. Since most of Rodia's Vulpes have stopped hunting their old

prey, many farmers in the region have asked the authorities to repopulate the
area with this particular variety.
"
Crashing Basilisk,"There are numerous myths about Basilisks. They are said to cause death with
a single glance, to have control over snakes, and even to be born from a
chicken egg hatched by a toad. Although none of those things are true, their
real powers make them dangerous creatures.

The Crashing Basilisk can use its voice to randomly activate any magic items
around it. With enough practice, it can hone its ability to avoid any detrimental
effects.
"
Crazed Leper,"As the disease progresses, the skin rots and the flesh falls off. Finally, the body
and the face swell, filled with bumps, and the brain begins to decompose.

When a Crazed Leper is ordered to join a battle, it can no longer be stopped,
although it never attacks its own allies. Instead, this creature will keep
destroying furniture, carriages or tents until someone hits its head and knocks it
unconscious.
"
Creep Mummy,"Magic was discovered during the rise of the first civilizations in the Kaito
Empire, far from the green meadows and cold mountains. Tradition dictated
that the kings and queens of that place had to undergo a ritual related to the
afterlife.

A sticky liquid drips constantly from the Creep Mummy's bandages. To kill
humans, this creature placed its hand on their faces to prevent them from
breathing or opening their eyelids.
"
Creeping Arachnalisk,"This Arachnalisk is extremely intelligent, and the only one able to speak.
Vertraag had to call in many favors from Yseros so that she would help him
create it as a ""show of courtesy and respect”, though it is doubtful that he
actually managed to deceive her. Shortly after its arrival to the Arachnid Nest,
the Arachnalisks divided into opposing factions and fought each other, resulting
in the deaths of hundreds of them and forcing Regalis herself to stop them and
exile the cunning instigator.
"
Crimson Manticore,"Few species have been created for the sole purpose of eliminating another.
Indeed, only one — Manticores. Their target: mankind.

The Crimson Manticore can smell the blood of a human at great distances.
When it finds its target, it moves stealthily, crouching, aware of where it places
its paws so as not to step on a branch or a pile of dry leaves. The victim will not
see this creature coming, as it always attacks from behind.
"
Crypt,"The Crypt was once a sacred place where the bodies of the deceased were laid
to rest so that they would have a peaceful journey to the afterlife. The first to
summon this creature was Baker, a renowned Life Mage who had recently lost
her great love. One night, she went into the cemetery and looked for her lover's
crypt to bring her back to life with an experimental spell. But something went
wrong, and instead of bringing her back, the spell gave life to the building in
which she was buried.
"
Crypt Bat,"Crypt Bats prefer dark, moist places to roost and hunt vermin. They usually
swoop down and dig their claws into the body of their prey before taking flight
again with it in tow. Although their vision is poor, they can use their bright eyes
to sense the body temperature of other creatures.
"
Crystal Smith,"Crystal Smiths, together with Brim Smiths and Hammer Lords, are the only
ones of their kind that have managed to successfully integrate in the towns and
villages of Rodia. Indeed, in kingdoms such as Vanelin or Undolim, where the
cult of Yseras is widespread, they were received with joy and admiration thanks
to their appearance. However, some of them live in the Gorgon colonies, where
they help their people thrive with their forging skills.
"
Crystaldune Gemling,"Modern Spell Gems that do not come from the forehead of a Carbuncle were
developed in the Refuge of the Magi. However, every success comes after
numerous failures, and Gemlings were one of them.

There are many solitary Gemlings, but none of them are Crystaldunes. They
usually choose a mate of any species and spend their lives close to them, often
orbiting continuously around them.
"
Cursed Automaton,"Automatons began to be mass-produced some time ago in a factory in Neralim
to supply the armies of the different kingdoms of Radia, but clandestine
factories quickly began producing them as well.

When an Automaton loses its master, it walks erratically and does not attack
anyone unless it is threatened.

The blades on the Cursed Automaton's hands do not cause physical injuries,
instead draining energy from their enemies. Anyone who is attacked by them
will also experience very vivid nightmares for three days.
"
Cursed Reaper,"Just like Banshees, Reapers can be seen when a life is about to end, or when a
catastrophe is about to occur. However, these creatures are silent and only
move when death comes. As they have eternal life, these beings have been
the target of numerous spells over the years. After being hit with a certain
number of curses, their structure changes and they become Cursed Reapers,
entities that bring bad luck to anyone who approaches them.
"
Cursed Slime,"When the Vengeful Bjinn was born, this creature emerged from the cauldron in
which the Nether Orb was boiling. Its very presence causes catastrophic events
with serious consequences for anyone near the creature. However, the Cursed
Slime itself is not evil, and it doesn't cause harm deliberately unless provoked.
It decided to escape before the Djinn uprising and now wanders the world,
involuntarily causing innumerable misfortunes in its path.
"
Cyclone,"Fascinated by the most violent storms of nature, Torun decided that the only
way he could improve them was to give them an angry face like his, so that
they could curse while unleashing their fury. For some reason, Storms seem to
hate fire, but instead of trying to extinguish it by raining on it, they emit powerful
electric shocks against the heat source with the intention of destroying it.

The Cyclone is the only one of its species who can use the lightning it produces
to temporarily blind its enemies.
"
Dancing Wisp,"Wisps have been known to take control of fresh corpses. When this happens,
the eyes of the lifeless body turn blue, and it moves to undertake bloody
revenge on those who aggrieved it in life. If the possessed body successfully
takes a life in the name of revenge, it dances on the corpse before moving on
to the next victim.

There are reports of Rift Dancers interacting with these creatures. Dancing
Wisps often reject them abruptly and look away, though they always end up
playing together in the end.
"
Dark Brim Smith,"Like the Gorgons, the Smiths had to endure adversity both in their land and in
what is now Rodia. Many of them began to wonder whether living with humans
was worth the trouble, and they declared the Scarlet Mountains of Vanelin their
territory.

Dark Brim Smiths are those who have renounced the forge and resort to
attacking caravans and human settlements, or at least mine for precious ore in
the mountain mines.
"
Darkeye Gargoyle,"During the Unification War, the army of Egas invaded the city of Undolim, but
Helmholtz and Milner were waiting for it. Together with Marette and the other
Magi of the capital, they gave life to these creatures and set a trap for him.

When a Darkeye Gargoyle fights for the cause that governs its movements,
magic manifests spontaneously around it. If it exceeds its limits, it remains
paralyzed for some hours.
"
Darkscythe Pilwiz,"Although they only live in villages and small towns, Pilwiz society is strongly
linked to that of humans, so much that both species have become dependent
on each other.

The Darkscythe Pilwiz is the guardian of the night. Many creatures wait under
the cover of darkness to stalk their prey or commit illegal activities related to
the theft of vegetables or cereals. This creature never warns and never asks
questions. It stealthily approaches any intruders and appears behind them,
ready to attack.
"
Darksulker,"The day to say goodbye had come. Mikhail, Elinar, Vyre, Hexilo, and River
ceased to be what they once were. Their last mission for the Auditors was
carried out: to save not only the world, but the entire universe from an
inexorable end. Their five new realms were ready, and the only thing that
remained was saying goodbye. Everyone except Mortem and Tenebris set out
on their journeys. ""River,"" said the god of Blood. ""It's Tenebris now, speak
properly,"" he replied. ""You weren't always so compliant with the rules.”
Tenebris smiled at his response. ""You took Linta, you heathen."" ""I know, so |
want to give you something."" The Darksulker appeared next to Tenebris.
Mortem knew Tenebris was raising an eyebrow under his cloak of darkness,
even though he couldn't see it. ""Come on, don't look at me like that. It's very
smart, I've told it about you and it agreed. I'm sure you'll be great friends."" The
Gods embraced each other, so tightly that the earth itself trembled. ""Goodbye,
Mortem."" ""I'll miss you, Tenebris.""
"
Daunting Gargantuan,"Gargantuans are the largest creatures on the planet. They can reach heights of
over 30 feet, but their movements are extremely slow and clumsy.

Daunting Gargantuans were born of the mountains on which humans had once
built mausoleums. When a creature dies in front of one of them, its soul joins
the Gargantuan's temporarily, which greatly increases its strength and speed.
"
Davey,"Davey is able to absorb the mist around its neck, but only during a new moon is
it able to release it. That is why this creature has been used on occasions by
Rodians to clear roads affected by this weather condition or to perform surprise
attacks. However, a simple spell can have the same effect, so ultimately its
usefulness in battle is viewed more as a last resort or as a decoy.
"
Dawn Crusader,"On rare occasions, Dawn Crusaders let other creatures ride on them. There is
a legend about four riders that lived great adventures on the backs of these
creatures and saved a distant kingdom from the tyranny of the powerful
X-Mage. The story of the Warriors of Dawn is also famous for being an
impeccable satire of the genre, and it has been translated into more than 140
different languages throughout the world.
"
Death Bat,"A long time ago, there was a Mutated Vampire Bat who stood out above the
rest in its knowledge of magic. It owned a large mansion and enjoyed
performing experiments in the company of other Bats. Needless to say,
something went very wrong, and its home blew up in an emerald-green blast,
giving birth to this Bat subspecies as a result. Now, Death Bats seek revenge
against magic itself.
"
Death Crafter,"These Smiths use dark arts to imbue their weapons with a corrupt power that
increases the strength of their allies’ artifacts. It is a ritual that requires the
sacrifice of a member of the Smith species. In the past, there were always
volunteers among those who had lost their families and those who had nothing
left but an empty, broken heart. These days, Death Crafters only sacrifice the
Smiths who renounce their lives in the Scarlet Mountains or the Gorgon
colonies.
"
Death Guard,"Aiter Taylor created the Whiptail Clutcher, he decided that the Torture
Chamber needed guards that could hurt and kill the convicts when he was busy
hurting and killing people in his castle.

A Doomguard's armor is part of its body. For the Death Guard, Taylor went to a
lot of effort to create an armor with no openings, imbued with extraordinary
magical powers that it could share with its allies.
"
Death Shapeshifter,"Most Shapeshifters are peaceful and do not feel any misgivings toward
strangers who enter their territory. When they reach a certain age, they
specialize in a certain class of transformations to optimize the results.

Some Shapeshifters act as shamans in their cultures. They talk to their people
about life and death, and guide and motivate them in their day-to-day life.
When they enter battle, they transform into unnatural creatures that should not
be alive.
"
Deathshead Beacon,"Two Nature Magi gave life to the Beacons centuries ago through a complex
ritual designed by Zonte himself, before he became a God.

The Death's Head Beacon's terrifying appearance earned it its name, though it
is not any more dangerous than other creatures of its kind. The flames its body
produces work exactly like the Atlas's flames, so only outsiders who wander
into the forests they inhabit have to worry about them.
"
Decaying Vulpes,"The energy unleashed by the activation of ten Nether Orbs at once had some
consequences for Rodia's animal kingdom.

This black-furred, bright-eyed fox left its deep forest habitat to feed on the
corpses of magical beasts. Its appearance may inspire mistrust, but it is
actually a harmless creature, as long as it is not hungry.
"
Deceptive Fiend,"The Deceptive Fiend was one of Vulcanar's pets for a long time. Gifted with
intelligence, it hated its master for treating it like a common beast. When the
God of Fire exiled the Fiends, it hid among them and escaped the Great
Pandemonium. It saw that mortals also treated creatures as slaves, and it
decided to devote its life to freeing as many beasts as it could from the yoke of
their masters, regardless of whether they were trained animals, pets or faithful
companions.
"
Decrepit Automaton,"The Automaton blueprints were illegaly sold by an unscrupulous scientist to
several wealthy people in Radia, including two of the top mafia bosses.

For an Automaton to recognize an individual as its master, the palm of their
hand must be placed on the machine's back for one minute. If it already
belonged to someone, their ownership will be overriden.

The Decrepit Automaton is a faulty but functional model, so no one usually
bathers to fix it. Plants grow quickly in its gears, tubes and body, and make
their way outward in a way that allows the machine to use them as weapons.
"
Deep Clutcher,"The Deep Clutcher catches its enemies by using its tentacles, which can be
more effective than the usual fingers of these creatures. Even if some
creatures can easily slip away from these tentacles, they will start to move
more slowly due to the paralyzing poison they secrete.
"
Defiant Defiler,"Although it looks like two different creatures, the Defiant Defiler has a single
mind. As night falls, a piercing scream escapes from its jaws. The time has
come to claim a victim. For hundreds of years it frightened several towns and
villages of what would later be known as Rodia, until a forest ranger discovered
that it attacks any humanoid form, regardless of whether it is alive. Once eaten,
the creature returns to its lair and does not return until the following night. This
is why even today the outskirts of many towns in Radia are littered with
scarecrows.
"
Delirious Ghoul,"Shortly before Omnia was invaded by Unification forces, King Sigmund
managed to develop a wretched spell which he used on the city's water supply.

Despite their appearance and status as undead, Ghouls are incredibly fast.
When the Delirious Ghoul stabs his enemies with the tentacles on its shoulder,
strange thoughts appear in their heads. Most of them experience doubts and
believe that they are about to become one of these creatures.
"
Delusion Occultist,"The foundation of the first kingdoms brought about a period of rapid
advancement in magic that culminated in the creation of the Refuge of the
Magi. But every boom has to end, and something finally went wrong.

Occulltists behave erratically and do not seem to have a purpose, although they
have an innate aptitude for magic. The Delusion Occultist exudes a strange
magic that nothing and no one can restrain.
"
Demented Carver,"A Demented Carver never stops looking for prey. When it finds some, it chops
the poor victims to small pieces it can eat, not caring whether they are dead or
alive during the process. It only collaborates with others when they promise a
great number of victims for it to carve. Extreme caution is advised when
dealing with this creature.
"
Demonic Voidlord,"Dragan and Cerys had a very close friendship that continued even as they both
went their separate ways. She is considered the greatest philosopher and
politician in history, an intellectual who managed to abolish hereditary
monarchy in Omnia, and at the same time laid the groundwork to make her
kingdom the most prosperous in the world.

The Devil Voidlord is believed to have taken the form and behaviour of a
sadistic, bloodthirsty creature that went extinct thousands of years ago. Its
attacks are easily recognized, as these creatures leave no traces of their own
involvement while also creating a grotesque scene. They strike, tear, bite, and
sever the limbs of their victims, leaving them completely and utterly mutilated.
"
Depravity Smith,"When King Misery began searching for Smiths throughout the kingdoms, some
of his slaves decided to help him by revealing where their acquaintances were
in exchange for freedom. From that moment they became a nomadic group of
renegades who reject cities, wars, kingdoms and their laws. At present, those
traitors are already dead, but their descendants have preserved their nomadic
tradition, as well as their resentment towards society.
"
Deranged Gorgon,"The Gorgons come from distant islands, and they fled to Radia to save
themselves from the genocide ordered by an evil human empress that ruled
over an entire continent. They are social creatures and enjoy city life, but their
appearance and their abilities instill fear wherever they go.

The Deranged are Gorgons who have suffered traumatic events and have
become extremely aggressive. Their gaze is so intense that they can leave
anyone who looks into their eyes petrified in fear.
"
Desert Priest,"Yseros knew that the peace brought on by the Priests was just an illusion. Still,
she decided that at least one kingdom would never know war. With Lister's
help, she created the Desert Priest, an immortal creature that would rule over a
new nation. It traveled the world and gathered the homeless. Years later, it led
them to a large oasis between the Barrens and the Faraway Enclave in western
Rodia. There, humans and creatures founded a new nation, which they called
Ahruna.
"
Destroyer Fiend,"Fiends hate the outdoors, as well as temperate and cold climates, so they are
rarely seen near human towns and cities. They prefer to live underground, next
to a source of intense heat.

The howl of a Destroyer Fiend turns its packmates into ferocious hunters. It has
recently been discovered that this howl also arouses the predator instinct of any
creature nearby. This effect can override the learned behavior of beasts raised
in captivity, especially when feeding.
"
Destruction Banshee,"Before Erebyss became the Goddess of Darkness, another entity held that
position. His purpose was to return the universe to its original state, but he
failed. Banshees are not aggressive by nature, but they can be very dangerous
when they feel threatened.

When a Destruction Banshee screams, its hands become fireballs that it uses
to defend itself. Ents are always very careful around them, as making one
angry could mean the end of a forest.
"
Diabolic Bhuta,"Also known as Supreme Leader by the members of the Diabolic Horde, it is
believed to be an emissary of Gonfurian, charged with spreading chaos
throughout the land. Only the Diabolic Commanders have seen it, which is why
it was thought to be a legend for a long time. However, it seems that he now
wants to personally oversee his plans for the Horde, since there have been
numerous reported sightings of it recently.
"
Diabolic Commander,"Diabolic Commanders are usually veterans of the Diabolic Horde that have
emerged victorious in numerous battles over the years and lived long enough
to tell their tales. Their authority over their squad is indisputable and their
decisions are never questioned, though they are usually open to suggestions
when it comes to designing a strategy or a battle plan. They are the only ones
in contact with the Diabolic Bhuta, the Supreme Leader of the Horde that
directs their operations from the shadows.
"
Diabolic Henchman,"The Diabolic Henchman usually acts as a scout when it travels with other
members of the Diabolic Horde. It examines footprints and other signs left
behind by enemies, allowing the Diabolic Horde to track them and deal with
them. Its secondary job is to hunt wild animals and to light fires at night that
improve the mood while the Diabolic Commander tells war stories.
"
Diabolic Insurgent,"This fiendish creature specializes in making a racket before the Diabolic
Horde's incursions, distracting their foes before they have a chance to regroup.
If the enemy has a bonfire, it whips it, creating a cloud of ash and smoke to
signify the start of the battle. It is also in charge of taming the beasts on which
the Diabolic Horde rides, making sure that, despite their violent nature, they
only bite their opponents.
"
Diabolic Intruder,"When this creature travels with other members of the Diabolic Horde, it usually
stays apart from the group, studying potential enemies according to the
information provided by the Diabolic Henchman. If it has the opportunity, it will
draw a battle plan before every fight. It uses its two polearms to distract its
enemies and gain a tactical advantage for the squad.
"
Diabolic Menace,"This creature is the most silent member of the Diabolic Horde. While everyone
else is eating and laughing around the campfire, this creature is usually alone
with its eyes closed, meditating on matters known only to itself. Its knowledge
of magic is exceptional and appreciated by its people, but in battle it prefers to
wield two axes to wipe out its enemies with fearsome might.
"
Diabolic Nemesis,"The Diabolic Nemesis is considered a shaman by the members of the Horde. It
often gives advice to its people and speaks to them about the Word of
Gonfurian and their sacred duty of fighting and pillaging. When it knows there is
a difficult fight ahead, it will start a ritual the night before the battle. This ritual
ends with the preparation of a brew to calm the spirit and make it more resilient.
"
Diabolic Observer,"This one-eyed creature specializes in battlefield analysis and threat detection.
In order to keep its voice in shape so that its warnings in battle are loud and
clear, it devotes part of its free time to singing songs about the beauty of nature
that are not fully appreciated by his comrades-in-arms of the Diabolic Horde.
"
Diabolic Rebel,"The Diabolic Rebel is truly a born leader among its people. It is always the one
with the decisive voice and it never fails to encourage its comrades-in-arms
with promises of glory and blood. Daring and tough, it is the first to jump into
battle, shouting loudly as it uses its twin torches to create a whirling vortex of
fire.
"
Diabolic Spectator,"The Diabolic Spectator never stops exercising its muscles, even while traveling,
as it relies on its own fists to bring down its enemies. When two
comrades-in-arms decide to resolve their differences by means of violence, this
creature usually tries to mediate between them by puffing its chest and
throwing a defiant look. This usually ends with the three of them fighting on the
ground, so it's hard to tell whether its intention is really to stop the conflict or to
join it as a show of strength.
"
Diabolic Watchman,"The Diabolic Watchman is the Horde's greatest expert in melee combat. It can
skillfully wield any weapon and it helps train its comrades-in-arms to improve
their physical abilities. It follows a strict training regimen from a young age that
only a few of its kind are able to endure. Few of its enemies forget the powerful
blows of its mace... if they live to tell about it.
"
Diamant,"This creature is Aurum's right hand, although it does not play a significant role
in the decisions made by the God of Vanity. Its role is to ensure everything is in
order in the Temple of Lies, but now, with the realm invaded by countless
threats, it is overwhelmed and remains motionless, as its decision-making
system is very limited. Fed up with its obvious incompetence, Aurum has
ordered it to just remain still. However, when faced with intruders, it must
solemnly communicate that, at any moment, death will be applied to them for
desecrating the land of the supreme God Aurum.
"
Diamond Imling,"When an Imler egg is exposed to magic for a certain amount of time, its
development changes and it is born as an Imling. Imlings are fertile, but their
eggs produce Imlers unless the process is repeated.

The magical qualities of the Diamond Imling are exceptional among its kind. In
the words of a Mage named Spielrein, who studied them for some time, ""it's as
if magic danced around them and wanted to obey their orders.""
"
Diamond Luckmantria,"Predators in the forests of Hutika know that Luckmantrias are not easy prey,
and that trying to hunt them is a complete waste of time. The universe seems
to conspire in their favor, preventing them from being eaten is such creative
ways as the fortuitous fall of a tree or a sudden indigestion.

Winter is the Diamond Luckmantria's favorite season. The cold is not a
problem for it, and it hides between mounds of snow to rest for long periods of
time. If anyone were to discover its location, it is very likely that they will slip
and fall flat on the ground.
"
Diamond Paragon,"Paragons are extremely long-lived and intelligent creatures that are integrated
into human society. They usually hold important positions as great merchants,
notaries or even advisors to the sovereigns of Rodia.

Diamond Paragons are especially interested in the fauna and flora of Rodia.
When the war ended, many of them joined teams of biologists in different cities
to study them. The University of Natural Science in Vanelin is currently directed
by one of them.
"
Dikya,"Dikya is an enthusiastic, inquisitive creature that devotes its life to scientific
research. However, it refuses to document its discoveries and only shares
them in exchange for any type of information that is not yet part of its vast
knowledge. Like some of the Gods, it can see what is happening anywhere
without being physically present, a skill that has made it the most renowned
informant in history. For this reason, Dikya is constantly being persecuted and
has been kidnapped countless times since it mysteriously appeared thousands
of years ago. However, these kidnappings usually do not last more than a few
days, as it is one of the greatest assets of the Auditors.
"
Dire Warhog,"Even today, when a group of Asura goes on the attack, they usually take a few
Warhogs with them.

The Dire Warhog is at its most dangerous when it charges, as orcs often equip
blades on their tusks that can easily pierce through armor. These creatures
move in their sleep much more often than any other Warhaog, at times even
getting up and unceremoniously ramming everything around them.
"
Disciple Occultist,"The Refuge of the Magi used to be the most prestigious tower of magic in the
world. After several decades of research, the Magi discovered how to alter
space inside the tower to increase the number of floors to infinity.

When an Occultist picks up a book, she sometimes holds it upside down and
starts turning two or three pages at a time. With a single touch of her hand, the
Disciple Occultist can turn any Spell Gem to dust.
"
Disease Crafter,"The genocide against non-human creatures in another continent led both
Smiths and Gorgons to take desperate measures. Hundreds of Smiths
sacrificed their own nature through a dark ritual that permanently transformed
them into abominable beings.

The Disease Crafter is deadly to humans and other creatures, but not to his
own kind.
"
Divine Phoenix,"This creature is not really a Phoenix, but an automaton programmed by the
Auditors to eliminate any outsider who manages to break through the barrier
surrounding the city of Ubi Concordia. Its flight is as deft as that of other
Phoenixes, but its call is metallic, high-pitched, and extremely unpleasant. The
energy released by its wings and tail damages both organic tissue and stone or
metal, and it can exhale bursts of it through its jaws when it enters combat.
"
Djinn Arcanomancer,"Before the disastrous incident that took place in the Refuge of the Magi, many
interesting prcjects were developed with the purpose of benefiting both the
magical community and the world. One of them was the Djinn Prcject.

The Djinn Arcanomancer's lamp contains an inexhaustible reserve of magic
that it can use to cast its own spells or to help its allies.
"
Djinn Dreamweaver,"The Magi of the Refuge wanted to create a creature that could grant simple
wishes to aid them with mundane tasks and in their investigations.

Some Djinn Dreamweavers hide in their lamp near trade routes until an
unsuspecting merchant confuses it with a valuable object due to its golden
color. At night, the creature comes out and modifies its target's dreams day
after day, introducing ideas and desires until it turns the victim into a slave.
"
Djinn Evoker,"To make sure the Djinns were obedient, their creators developed a mechanism
in the form of an oil lamp that could contain them and force them to obey
orders.

The Djinn Evoker presents itself as a kind and understanding creature who
likes to listen to people's problems. It acts as a confidant, but the longer an
individual remains in its presence, the more their negative emotions build up.
"
Djinn Ghula,"The Djinn uprising in the Refuge of the Magi culminated with the appearance of
this fearsome creature. Its extraordinary magical powers guided its brothers in
a bloody battle in which they already had a great advantage. The Djinns had
prepared well. Most of the Magi were at odds with one another and could not
work together. Soon, Zonte and Ainsworth understood there was nothing to do.
With great regret, they left their home with the other sane Magi. And then, they
received a visit.
"
Djinn Illusionist,"Djinn owners realized too late that these creatures twisted their words as much
as possible to grant wishes that caused some damage.

When a Djinn Illusionist touches a magic item, it steals its energy and stores it
for itself. In this way, it can make others see things that are not really there,
playing with their emotions and thoughts to manipulate them and make them
distrust their friends and colleagues.
"
Djinn Pyromancer,"For years, the Djinns made their creators believe that they could not leave their
lamps. They cautiously developed an elaborate plan to take control of the
Refuge of the Magi.

Vulcanar was especially fascinated when he saw a Djinn Pyromancer
accompanying one of Zonte's apprentices during a visit to the Great
Pandemonium. This creature involuntarily alters the structure of spells and
channels their energy to produce fire around it and burn its enemies.
"
Docile Wolpertinger,"Lister once came across a Wolpertinger clutch. Having witnessed the violence
of the chicks, he decided to intervene by completely altering the nature of these
creatures. Docile Wolpertingers sleep most of the time, and they are peaceful
and completely harmless... unless they are bothered. When one feels that it is
in danger, its murderous instincts awaken, filling it with rage and making it even
more dangerous than the rest of its kind.
"
Dolor Sin,"Baker tried all possible means to bring Spielrein back to life, but she failed.
Broken with pain and guilt, she joined the Sin cult for two years, but her
sadness and need for revenge consumed her. One day, she bypassed
Ainsworth's security and stole another Nether Orb. Back in Siralim, she
stabbed herself with a shard from the Magnificus's knife that had been left
inside Spielrein, letting her blood bathe the Nether Orb. It was consumed, and
out of its ashes and her blood emerged the Dolor Sin.
"
Doom Clutcher,"The Clutchers roam the endless corridors of the Torture Chamber, looking for
victims to grab so that they cannot escape Tartarith's punishment. When the
God appears, the Doom Clutcher uses its ability to sense the victims' lifespans,
usually no more than a few hours. Then, the creature shows this countdown to
the helpless individuals, letting them know how long their agony will be.
"
Doom Devil,"When it finds a person in a tavern that looks sad and lonely, it will approach
them and offer a deal. Once they shake its right hand, their fate is sealed. The
Doom Devil usually returns favors in its own way, killing someone if possible.
Once they fulfill their part of the deal, the Devil takes advantage of wording of
the deal to, at best, leave them without a single coin. If they do not fulfill their
part, their heart simply stops beating.
"
Doom Mummy,"The sovereigns of Kaito were mummified after death and placed inside large
pyramids with strange spherical otjects, whose power was still unknown to
humans at that time.

The Doom Mummy's appearance was terrifying for the people of Kaito. As if it
were a nightmare, this creature burst into the houses and showed the rotten
flesh beneath its bandages. The more frightened its victims were, the more
powerful its blows became.
"
Doomblight Angel,"This creature was created in times of need to mercilessly annihilate anything
that crossed its path. When one of them stumbles upon a town, it does not stop
until either someone stops it or it kills every single inhabitant. Like the rest of
the Angels, they fought on the side of the Gods in an ancient war. To achieve
victory, a sacrifice was necessary, as there can be no light without darkness.
Someone had to contain that darkness, but only the wisest of them, the eternal
one, knew that secret.
"
Doomsday Spectre,"While the war mercilessly raged on Radia, Sigmund sought the Nether Orbs
with the purpose of becoming a god. The battles were cruel and there was
often violence within the cities.

Whenever a newborn died from steel or from the spells that flew through the
streets, this creature appeared while its former family looked on in fear, if any
of them were still alive.
"
Dormant Basilisk,"It is a common misconception that the power of the Basilisks is contained in
their eyeballs. A study carried out in the Refuge of the Magi confirmed that their
powers still worked after removing their eyes.

The Dormant Basilisk has great regenerative abilities: even if they lose their tail
or an arm, they grow back in a matter of seconds. Potions that contain hair of
this creature are commonly sold on the black market. The most frequent effect
after ingesting these products is acute diarrhea.
"
Draco Chimera,"Chimeras have little need for food, but they have been created in such a way
that the meat of the species that commonly try to harm T'mere's creations is
especially appetizing to them.

Draco Chimeras are generally in charge of military strategy. All three heads
think fast and can agree on a plan with astonishing speed and no need for
words. Additionally, since they can fly over the battlefield, they can use their six
eyes to observe many places at once, allowing them to adjust their battle plans
with a broader perspective.
"
Dragon Guardian,"The main reason why the Unsullied Meadows remain unsullied are the
Dragons. Together with other creatures, they prevent everyone from destroying
or permanently settling in that beautiful place.

Dragon Guardians protect the clutches and are the least merciful to intruders.
They know all the tricks after all the years they have been doing their job.
Sometimes they let the poachers believe they are safe, only to ram them with
the steely scales of their foreheads when they lower their guard.
"
Dragon Queen,"Dragons were the work of Aeolian, long before humans built their cities and
established their kingdoms. They dedicate a great part of their lives to
gathering piles of gold and jewels that they use as a bed.

Not all Dragons live in groups, but those who do are always governed by a
Dragon Queen. In critical situations, the Queen is able to assess the situation
in a matter of seconds and figure out the enemy's strategy to turn it against
them.
"
Dragon Revenant,"Many poachers look for Dragon eggs due to their attractiveness and the high
price at which they are sold, so many Dragons have decided to leave the
Unsullied Meadows and establish their lair in more remote places.

The Dragon Revenant is the most elusive of its kind, as it lives on its own and
never communicates with anyone unless it needs something. Its knowledge of
magic is comparable to that of the most versed Magi, since it collects sorcery
books and Spell Gems with which it practices daily.
"
Dragon Scout,"Dragons that want a lair outside the Unsullied Meadows often choose a nest of
Arachnalisks to establish it, since these creatures do not care about their
treasures and even protect them from intruders.

The Dragon Scout never stays in the same place for long, as it likes to meet
other people and cultures, and acquire wisdom about the art of war through its
travels. There is not a single human, Elf, or Ent able to surprise one in battle,
so it is one of Rodia's most dangerous opponents.
"
Dragon Sentinel,"The Dragons’ mating season occurs during the summer solstice, when
hundreds of them can be seen intertwining in mid-air and looping in a majestic
dance of beauty and mystery.

Dragon Sentinels are the watchmen of the Unsullied Meadows, and are always
in contact with Ents, Moss Golems, and other creatures that protect nature,
which update them on what is happening in the vast Meadows. Their tracking
ability and their acute sense of smell mean not a single infraction escapes their
notice.
"
Dragon Soldier,"The Dragon Soldier received its name centuries ago, when King Misery placed
the city of Neralim under siege with his army of knights and creatures. The
Unification forces could not abandon their positions to help the city, but Milner
had an idea. She went to the Unsullied Meadows and spoke with the Dragon
Queens, but they did not listen. Distressed, she put her hope in a legend. Her
wish made these creatures emerge from the sea and give their lives for the
country without asking for payment.
"
Dragon Spirit,"In times of crisis, Dragons can perform a ritual that literally materializes their
faith in their own people. This extraordinary manifestation has no awareness
and only obeys very simple orders, but in battle it is a formidable ally as strong
as any other Dragon. When its services are no longer required, it disappears
like a beam of light spreading in all directions.
"
Dragonlair Arachnalisk,"Though Dragonlair Arachnalisks love dark and labyrinthine caves in which to
hunt their prey, they have little appreciation for valuables. This is why some
Dragons chose them to protect their treasure after the children of Regalis were
introduced into Rodia a long time ago. It was undoubtedly their countless
encounters with treasure hunters that gave them their name.
"
Dread Hound,"The superiority of human intelligence made them believe they had the right to
play God, crossbreeding different species of wolves to obtain creatures of
which to take advantage. With the rise of magic, these practices began to
include spells and rituals, which ended up creating these creatures.

The Dread Hound's bite is extremely dangerous, as it fills its victims’ minds
with intrusive thoughts of impending doom, making them lose concentration
during battle.
"
Dread Spectre,"With his knowledge of time, Sigmund found a way to unleash a curse on Rodia.
This curse still exists today, and neither Helmholtz, Milner nor the current ruler
of Siralim have found a way to dispel it.

When a Spectre loses the baby it carries, it heads to the nearest city to kidnap
another and transforms into this creature. It is frailer than the rest of its kind, but
touching it allows one to feel the newborn's emotions and causes a permanent
state of mental alienation after a few seconds.
"
Dread Wight,"Many were the kingdoms that fell during Rodia's Unification War. Wights were
once warriors who fought on the wrong side, and now roam the country looking
for revenge.

The Dread Wight may not be a great fighter, but its rage-fueled spirit makes it a
formidable adversary, capable of rising again and again regardless of its
injuries.
"
Dreadful Efreet,"Vulcanar had never intended to help Zonte and the other Magi take back their
tower. However, shortly after emerging from the lava of the Great
Pandemonium, the Dreadful Efreet ordered the Obsidians to open a portal to
the Refuge of the Magi, and they obeyed. The assault was so quick and
effective that the Magi who accompanied them were more concerned with
putting out fires than with attacking. Finally, the Dreadful Efreet forced the Djinn
Ghula to leave the tower with the rest of the Djinns.
"
Drifting Shade,"Shades are the residual energy left behind when the soul of an evildcer leaves
its body for the afterlife. However, they are not eternal. When a certain time has
passed after their ""birth"", they begin slowly disintegrating, becoming a Drifting
Shade that eventually ends up disappearing altogether.
"
Dryad Keeper,"Dryads are denizens of the forest, but some also live in the Cutthroat Jungle
and the Unsullied Meadows. They are active protectors of nature, although they
prefer to use words to persuade those who threaten it.

When tenacious lumberjacks or Flamehook Pilwiz attack a Dryad Keeper after
refusing to stop their activities, her first response is to protect herself with her
shield. If she is attacked again, she uses the orb in her right hand to call on
every nearby creature and annihilate the threat.
"
Dryad Naturalist,"Since the burden of protecting the forests was becoming increasingly heavy for
the Ents alone, they asked Aeolian to help them in their important task. At
present, most forests are threatened by the activities of several intelligent
species, especially those of humans.

When a Dryad Naturalist finds a withering tree, she uses her power to create a
sphere of life that she puts into the trunk. In this way, the tree recovers its color
and continues to grow strong and healthy.
"
Dryad Proliferator,"Aeolian listened to the Ents and created the Dryads from the oaks that
populated the forests. At first, they were unable to move more than half a mile
away from the tree that had given them life.

In the past, it was believed that Dryad Proliferators had the ability to create life
from nothing. However, their power only allows them to accelerate the growth
of plants, with certain limitations. If they were exceeded, they Dryads would end
up consuming themselves and the tree that gave them life.
"
Dryad Raincaller,"Dryads are linked to the oak from which they came. Dryads receive any
damage made to their tree, which causes them pain. In the same way, healing
the wounds of a Dryad also regenerates her tree.

Aeolian put special effort when creating the Dryad Raincallers. When the
drought becomes an obstacle to the regeneration of a devastated forest, they
perform a beautiful dance that summons the Storms. These creatures release
their water where the Dryads believe it is most necessary.
"
Dryad Seductress,"The Dryad Seductress is a mysterious creature whose existence is linked to an
oak in which a poet carved eight romantic verses. This creature sings a tender
melody as she approaches those who exploit the resources of nature. Her
voice produces a state of obtundation, preventing her targets from moving.
When she is in front of her victims, she raises her right hand and tears a part of
their soul, then buries it in the ground. From that moment, they entrust their
lives to the protection of nature.
"
Dryad Sunbather,"When Calkins taught the Dryads to carry a sprout of their oaks so they could
travel greater distances, there were some that moved away from the forests
and jungles in search of the radiant sun. Those that reached the coasts kept
their purpose, but the strong heat gradually changed them as generations
passed, until they became Dryad Sunbathers. These creatures’ whispers force
whoever hears them to obey their commands, although they don't affect those
with a strong will.
"
Dryad Vindicator,"Faced with an increase in harmful human activities, the famous Nature Mage
Calkins had an idea for the Dryads to overcome their limitations. With the help
of other Nature Magi, she enchanted a sprout of each oak and gave it to the
Dryads.

The Dryad Vindicator uses her wooden sword to punish any creature she finds
cutting trees or damaging bushes. The wounds she inflicts cause her victims to
undergo a slow but inexorable transformation into the plant they were harming.
"
Dryad Warden,"At present, dryads carry a sprout from the tree that gave them life. In this way,
they can travel to distant lands, and even plant the sprout to replace their oak if
it were to perish.

When a Dryad Warden finds someone lighting a fire where they should not,
she uses her power to absorb the heat of the flames and holds it over her hand.
With a homicidal look in her eyes, she throws the fire at the offender to burn
them alive.
"
Dryskin Spellmane,"Spellmane-hunting techniques are highly diverse, ranging from patiently
stalking from the undergrowth to a frontal attack on the target.

One of the biggest dangers of the Barrens is the Dryskin. Although their
camouflage is perfect under the sand, most of the time they simply run at full
speed towards their prey the moment they detect its presence.
"
Duckgundr,"The Auditors recently constructed a snake-shaped device that can penetrate
the rifts that led the Watchers to this world thousands of years ago. They
wanted find out what lies on the other side, and hopefully find a way to close
them once and for all. For the first time in history, something went through the
rifts in the opposite direction. However, what came back was organic, had a
beak, and had duct tape on its tail. A tape that obviously was not enough to
close the rifts. Dragan looked at the creature with a raised eyebrow and said
‘Whatever is on the other side is laughing at us’, although what really happened
was somewhat different—the intentions of whatever was on the other side
translated into sarcasm when Duckgundr returned to our world, transforming it
as a result.
"
Dumpling,"Dumplings are extremely rare and peaceful creatures whose existence was
doubted for a very long time. Great power can be obtained by eating them, and
some believe that consuming their flesh can even grant extraordinary abilities
such as immortality or telekinesis. They are very sociable and enjoy the
company of other creatures, but their delicious appearance and the legends
surrounding them often turn them into prey... if one can catch them before they
flee.
"
Dungeon Shade,"Contrary to popular belief, not all Shades are obsessed with killing people.
Proof of this are the Dungeon Shades, which like to hide in dark places,
attaching themselves to the ceiling, to a suit of armor, or to some other
decorative object. When someone passes by one of them, it extends its hand
discreetly to swipe their belongings.
"
Dusk Crusader,"Crusaders are not self-aware. They are guided by a natural instinct that leads
them to carry out their actions.

Dusk Crusaders are active at night, flying low in search of evildoers. After the
Unification War, the council of Rodia entrusted Helmholtz's team with the
""Night Watch"" prcject. It was a great success, and since then several patrols of
Dusk Crusaders fly over the towns and cities of the country at night to
safeguard order.
"
Dusk Ossein,"Mortem carved these terrifying creatures out of the bone of the Titan, and to
give them life he used his own hair, putting it inside each of their jaws. Their
bodies seem to be impervious to damage, but they collapse like any other
creature after receiving enough hits. The Dusk Ossein, in fact, constantly
behaves as if it had been defeated. It camouflages itself in the ground, and it
can be mistaken for a bunch of rocks which color varies depending on where it
is. This fact is also used as proof by those who believe the Ossein have a
certain degree of consciousness.
"
Dusktail Gargoyle,"When a Gargoyle senses evil intentions in a creature, it dives to attack without
mercy. However, after the Unification War, other Magi decided to create their
own gargoyles, and at present some attack travelers to steal their belongings
for their masters.

The Dusktail Gargoyle extends its wings to drain the magic power of its
enemies. It digs its tail on the ground to remain static, preventing the force of its
own ability from pushing it away from its targets.
"
Ear Animation,"When an Animation is brought to life, it will obey any command from its
creator, no matter what it is.

Even the quietest footsteps can be perceived by the Ear Animation, which is
why many necromancers use these creatures to watch their lairs. If they are
forced to strike physically, they will frantically spin and quickly get out of the
way to avoid receiving a counterattack.
"
Earth Salamander,"When an old ruler of Siralim ascended to godhood, some of the creatures in
Rodia underwent a transformation. This event turned the Salamanders into
elemental creatures, able to adapt in an unusual way to all kinds of hostile
environments.

The Earth Salamander digs tunnels quickly to protect itself from the cold and
other inclement weather. It likes to hide underground and surprise its enemies
with deadly spells.
"
Ebony Ent,"Ents are incredibly long-lived creatures, but their roots often break due to their
long trips, forcing them to remain immobile for a long time to regenerate.

Many birds like to nest in the trunk and branches of the Ebony Ent, sa it is
common to see these creatures accompanied by small sparrows, blackbirds or
even magpies.
"
Ectoplasmic Slime,"Zonte discovered that these creatures emerged from the waste resulting from
the experiments that were carried out in the Refuge of the Magi.

The Ectoplasmic Slime brims with Life magic and cannot stand the sight of
suffering. During the many wars of Rodia, these creatures devoted themselves
to helping people and creatures that had been attacked while trying to hide or
flee.
"
Efflorescent Ent,"An Efflorescent Ent's only task is to plant the flowers that grow on its trunk and
branches. After a few weeks, the buds grow and become adult cherry trees.
Any Ent except the Timeworn can bloom into an Efflorescent Ent, and it only
happens when a Springtime Aspect finds it necessary, in areas specially
harmed by humans or natural catastrophes. The Springtime Aspect has to
touch the Ent with its staff to trigger this unique transformation.
"
Eft Climber,"Ets were once common salamanders that Apocranox brought with him after
creating the Blood Grove. Although he populated his realm with more species
of animals, not all of them became terrifying creatures like the Ets.

The Eft Climber can climb over thirty feet in a matter of seconds. In this way,
they keep the treetop-dwellers distracted while the other Efts climb more
cautiously.
"
Eft Elder,"Ets are terrifying carnivourous beasts. They have an excellent sense of smell,
and their eyes allow them to detect living beings at great distances. They can
also perceive heat in the dark.

Etts usually live short lives, as Satyrs and Inquisitors exterminate them
whenever they find their nests, and Efts sometimes cannibalize each other for
food. However, some Efts survive long enough to become Elders. Efts have a
somewhat confusing hierarchy, as the place each individual occupies is never
clear, but herds that have an Elder always survive for much longer.
"
Eft Howler,"Despite their violent nature, Efts can be tamed if they are raised from an egg.
However, one still needs to be cautious when dealing with these extremely
violent creatures, as anyone could become their main course if they have
nothing else to put in their mouths.

This creature's howls are powerful and terrifying, and hearing the sound often
means that one is in serious trouble. In exchange for losing the surprise factor,
Eft Howlers confuse and scare prey to make them easier to kill.
"
Eft Scavenger,"Etts prey on every single creature that inhabits the Blood Grove. Neither the
Inquisitors, who live underground, nor the Satyrs, who build their homes in the
treetops, are safe from these fearsome monsters.

Eft Scavengers are the easiest of their kind to tame. Unlike other Etts, their
instincts do not lead them to hunt, as their main role is to protect the young in
the nest from possible attacks.
"
Eft Stalker,"When hunting, Efts work in groups, and their coordination is so good that they
hardly ever fail to catch their prey. They grunt to communicate their position,
and they wave their tails to indicate where they are going to move.

The Eft Stalker is an expert at camouflaging itself in nature. It usually remains
motionless while other Efts chase prey and lead them to the Stalker, so it can
deliver the coup de grace. On its own, it can hide behind a bush for hours until
some unwary animal gets too close.
"
Elder Cruncher,"Crunchers are born from the walls and columns of the Temple of Lies. This
phenomenon has not been studied in depth, as access to this realm was
restricted until very recently.

Due to their aggressive behavior, not many Crunchers reach the end of their
life expectancy, but those who survive for over two hundred years become
Elder Crunchers. These are the smartest of their kind and know how to choose
their prey, so they sooner or later end up leading small groups of younger
Crunchers.
"
Elder Ent,"At the end of its long life, the structure of an Ent changes and a sticky moss
begins to cover its body. It is common to find hummingbirds and other small
birds around it, and a scientist from Vanelin discovered that they ignore the
insects that get trapped in the mass, instead eating the moss itself. The
scientist caught one of these creatures to study it and found out that its skin
contained a hallucinogenic substance that is addictive to birds.
"
Eldritch Grimoire,"Shortly after becoming the Hidden Grimoire, Cornell started researching the
transmigration that souls undergo after death. Using small rodents as test
sukjects he discovered, among other things, that this phenomenon happens
exactly nine minutes and seven seconds after a living being perishes. His most
notable find, however, was the fact that Spell Gems leave a mark on a soul,
one that remains at the very least throughout the entire process of
transmigration. With great caution he created a Grimoire that was able to
manipulate this magic. He gave it a terrifying appearance, hoping to scare the
looters, but also gave it a personality that would drive it to take care of animals,
trying to make amends for the many creatures that had died for his research.
However, for obvious reasons, animals usually flee in terror at its presence.
"
Electropod Ant,"The Electropads were designed by a scientist in the north of the continent, a
long way from Radia. In that place, magic has developed more slowly, as the
number of Nether Orbs found there is not very high.

The Ant Electropod loves to lift all kinds of things when it is not complying with
any order, but its strength is not proportional to a real ant, so on more than one
occasion it has destroyed its mandibles or other parts of its body when trying to
lift an object that was too heavy.
"
Electropod Beetle,"The electrical energy that flows through the circuits of the Electropods is the
key to their intelligence and movement, and magic is essential to produce it.

When a Beetle Electropod lunges, it can break through walls of solid stone.
Although their potential in battle is immense, the scientist who gave them life
would rather see them help farmers transport large balls of manure from one
place to another.
"
Electropod Fly,"The Electropads are just the first step of an ambitious prcject that aims to
replace organs and limbs with synthetic machinery. These creatures’ lifeforce
will simply not be depleted unless magic or physical force destroys them.

No other Electropad travels as fast as the Fly Electropod when it takes flight. In
addition, it is capable of changing direction with spectacular speed. However,
hovering at high speeds quickly drains its energy, so it needs to rest right away.
"
Electropod Mantis,"The Electropods are much larger creatures than the insects they are based on.
As long as they do not receive an order, they will behave identically to their
counterparts.

The edge of the Mantis Electropod's scythes is as dangerous as that of the
sharpest sword. With enough force, it can cut through metal like butter.
Sometimes, when they sway with the wind on a tree branch, it ends up split in
two.
"
Electropod Scorpion,"Creatures as simple-looking as the Electropods are in fact the technological
pinnacle of the continent, other than Ubi Concordia.

The synthetic venom the Scorpion Electropod produces is as dangerous as the
worst of its organic counterparts. In addition, its claws strike with devastating
force, allowing it to split a tree trunk (or armor) in two with terrifying ease.
"
Electropod Spider,"Constructs are nothing new on the continent, but the machinery that gives life
to all the others is simpler than that of the Electropods, and requires
maintenance from time to time.

The sound produced by the legs of the Spider Electropod when it moves easily
give away its presence. However, this creature can produce a synthetic silk
with which it can hang and attack without being heard.
"
Elemental Familiar,"The flame on its head never goes out, so it tries to stay away from forests and
villages that could accidentally catch fire. Before attacking its enemies, it deftly
moves its burning staff to create an impressive spiral of fire. If they do not back
down, it will flap its wings strongly to create a heat wave, then place its torch
near the clothes of its enemies.
"
Elf Barbarian,"The Elves inhabit the dark forests in the southern regions of the Rodian
Cutthroat Jungle, and they are not exactly kind to visitors. The Centaurs tried to
conquer their home thousands of years ago, and there has been little love
between the two races since then.

When an Elf Barbarian finds someone lurking around its territory, it will charge
towards them with a battle cry, then jump while raising its weapons to deliver a
powerful blow.
"
Elf Brawler,"Elf Monks are not the only ones who make the decision to fight without
weapons. Some Elves learn to use their entire bodies as weapons and become
Elf Brawlers. Every few months they organize a traditional tournament in which
only these Elves fight in single combat to win the Belt of Purple Leaves. Of
course, there is no betting on these matches, as the practice is banned in Elf
lands.
"
Elf Cleric,"Elves are devoted protectors of nature that try to spread their ideas and
customs to the rest of Rodia, by any means necessary.

Clerics are usually the spokespersons of their message, though if they are not
treated with respect, as is usually the case, they let their maces do the talking
instead. In battle, they prefer being on the front lines and try to make the
enemies lower their guard so that another Elf can take advantage and attack
them by surprise.
"
Elf Drifter,"Broca the Drifter is a legendary warrior who left his village centuries ago to lead
a solitary life. He is the oldest Elf currently alive and as he himself affirmed, the
most bored with life in the forest. In his time, he was at once the most skillful
Huntsman and Rogue, and over time he developed his own style. One of his
exploits as The Drifter was to find the entrance to the town of the Centaurs,
although he did not participate in the attack as he disagreed with the orders to
annihilate them.
"
Elf Huntsman,"Elves feed on leaves, roots and fruit, never harming other creatures in the
process. Therefore, an Elf Huntsman does not hunt animals, but intruders, or
as they call them: ""Utter fools"" or ""Insolent creatures who think they don't need
an invitation to enter our domains and sully them with their disrespectful
customs”. Elf Huntsmen are the fastest and most skilled. They jump among the
branches and hide in the leafy trees to remain undetected before they fall on
their enemies and end their lives.
"
Elf Monk,"Only an Elf beyond the age of 300 can aspire to become a true Monk. Not
using weapons is part of their path, as they believe nature must be preserved
intact, without a single scratch, and belongings are but a weight for the body.
Therefore, their only food is the energy that the forest itself wishes to grant
them. Despite their radical views, Monks do not impase their beliefs on others,
and they are treated with veneration.
"
Elf Mystic,"During the new moon phase, the Elves usually climb into the treetops to gaze
at the velvety night sky, speckled with countless stars. There, Elf Mystics sing
ancient songs in a solemn voice about, among other similar things, the rustling
of leaves when they are swayed by the wind. Besides appeasing the soul of
their people, they can channel the energy of the forest into their scepters and
use it to blow up their enemies.
"
Elf Rogue,"Elves do not live forever, and the older they get, the more vulnerable to disease
they become. However, their longevity is legendary, and some even live
beyond a thousand years of age.

Elves are also extremely agile and clever, and Elf Rogues are trained to
harness the maximum potential of their bodies. They move stealthily in the
shadows and determine their enemies’ movements while looking for the right
moment to strike a mortal blow.
"
Elqor,"Though it once served as Zonte's personal familiar, the all-too-curious god
granted Elqor's request for the freedom to explore the world on its own. The
mental bond between Zonte and Elgor still remains, however, and the two often
hold trivial conversations and share their discoveries with each other just like
the good old days. Some time ago, the Auditors contacted it and it had an
audience with one of their members. Due to its incredible potential, it was
offered a position as executor, but Elqor politely declined the offer and went
back the way it had come.
"
Emerald Carbuncle,"Humans hunted Carbuncles to near-total extinction as they waged war against
their neighboring towns and cities. The Watcher War began soon after.

Emerald Carbuncles are braver and more cunning than the rest of their
species. Taking advantage of their cute and delicate appearance, they
approach children who are playing away from their parents and attract them by
levitating happily around them. When it gets their attention, it leads them into
the middle of the forest until a predator finds them and kills them.
"
Emerald Paragon,"During the Unification War, Lister realized that the fragile peace he had
achieved with the help of the Priests had completely shattered. Through the
gem he always holds in his hands he gave life to the Paragons to help the
righteous.

The Emerald Paragon is aggressive and grumpy, and when it gets angry it hits
a wall with its fists and throws okjects on the floor. Everything around it seems
to be more fragile.
"
Emlai,"King Misery was defeated and killed 723 years ago in the throne room of his
own kingdom, but his thirst for vengeance allowed his spirit to remain in this
world. Caedo, his kingdom, became part of Gonfurian's realm, and from there
he planned his return for centuries. Emlai, the last Caedo Seraph, seeks
retribution for its king, who was crucified as a heretic for the second time so
many years ago by none other than the ruler of Siralim. Emlai's thirst for
vengeance will not be quenched until Siralim, and all the people who
contributed to its king's untimely demise, are wiped from the face of Rodia.
"
Emus,"It was a young Raven who discovered the existence of Muse and the Astral
Gallery. He was a really promising young wizard. While studying the magic that
allows dimensional travel, that is, moving to the different realms, he noticed a
small loophole that allowed him to enter the realm of the Godess of Creation.
Fascinated by the living artistic display that was there, he decided to bring a
human friend, the person he trusted the most. Very soon they met Emus, the
second in command. She kindly asked them to keep the existence of that place
a secret, fearing the inevitable if it became known. The Raven and the human
understood her request and reassured her that they already planned to try to
hide her existence from the world. Emus thanked them deeply, and in time a
good friendship blossomed. The Raven later cast a powerful spell that further
concealed the entrance, but also warned Emus that sooner or later someone
would find a way to bypass the wards, a prediction that hundreds of years later
would come true.
"
Enclave Amaranth,"At the dawn of civilization, the Amaranths fell from the sky. Yseros hurried to
Eternity's End and met with Vertraag. ""Was that you?"" she asked. ""No,""
answered the God of Time. A smile appeared on his face. ""It was no one. They
were already here.""

When a spell hits the Enclave Amaranth, part of the magic bounces off its body
and moves toward the caster. It is common to find groups of these creatures
after a natural disaster, staring at the damage.
"
Enim Ophan,"Yseros knew that the size and shape of Watchers, as well as their ability to fly,
made them especially lethal as spellcasters. The first human biologists who
studied Ophans discovered that, despite their intelligence, they do not have the
biological support to move or to think. It was three centuries later, when magic
became part of the scientific method, that another biologist found that the ring
around their body has a magical circuit that emulates the usual structures of
other living beings.
"
Entropic Spectre,"One of Sigmund's most evil acts was to test his curse on the youngest prince
of Siralim. In the middle of the night, a heartrending cry echoed in the halls of
the castle. The frightened Queen got out of bed and desperately looked for
him. Near the stables, she found the Entropic Spectre holding her son,
although she did not know its true nature. The Queen vanquished the Spectre
with ease, but as it vanished she realized in shock that its existence and her
son's life had merged into one.
"
Erebyss,"Vertraag and Erebyss had lived together in Arcadia for centuries. Faced with
the threat of the God of Darkness, Vertraag convinced him to attack Erebyss
first, saying she was the weakest. He lied. The armies of Angels and demons
devastated Arcadia in a battle that claimed thousands of lives, until Erebyss
realized there was only one way to defeat her foe. She let him pierce her skull
with his sword, then used her full power to absorb the God's darkness, which
spread through Erebyss and her realm. Vertraag appeared before a different
Erebyss. She looked drained. ""Why did you not help me?"" she asked. ""There
can be no light without darkness,"" he replied.
"
Eternal Divinity,"The Eternal Divinity is the only being to whom other Demigods will bow to,
even if reluctantly. This is partly because it was the last work of the Gods, the
youngest brother as well as the epitome of perfection among its kind. It knows
everything that has been and many of the things that will be. Its abilities are
beyond mortal ken, and to defeat it is a pipe dream for everyone but a few.
"
Eternaldew Gemling,"When Gemlings came to life in the Refuge of the Magi, they turned on their
creators and mercilessly annihilated hundreds of them. Nothing could stop
them.

Eternaldew Gemlings have the ability to condense the humidity around them to
produce water in large quantities. However, in captivity by humans, they
produce another compound by adding an oxygen atom to it.
"
Ethereal Basilisk,"At present, it is known that the powers of the Basilisks work through their voice.
If their scream is interrupted before it takes effect, they must start from the
beginning.

Due to the ghostly appearance of the Ethereal Basilisk, it was thought for a long
time to be a soul, trapped in this world. The truth is that it is as organic as the
rest of its kind. Its scales, like the rest of its body, are extremely sensitive to
magic, and acquire this color at birth after being exposed to it.
"
Ethereal Clutcher,"Clutchers can sense fear over great distances. Before approaching an
unarmed, terrified victim, they hide and move slowly, scratching the cold stone
with their nails.

The Ethereal Clutcher can prcject terrifying images and scenes into people's
minds, even when they are asleep. When Tartarith is especially busy ""DOING
THE KILLING"", he orders these creatures to have fun with his future victims.
"
Evergreen Ent,"During the winter festivities, many people around the world decorate a fir so
that it resembles an Evergreen Ent. These creatures live in snowy places and
never stray too far from home. If they see a stranger attacking an animal, they
sink their roots in the snow and extend them to deliver a surprise blow to the
aggressor.
"
Evernight Shade,"The scientific community debated for centuries whether Shades are intelligent
creatures. The advancement of magic and the development of more rigorous
experimentation methods finally revealed the truth: though some of their
actions are quite elaborate, they are instinctive creatures.

Evernight Shades hide in the darkness, and are especially dangerous when the
sun sets, or in places where light is scarce, as they are invisible to most
creatures.
"
Evil Spirit,"This creature owes its name to its sinister appearance that has scared many
travelers. However, people who live near caves or very dense forests where
sunlight barely shines through the canopy know there is no reason to be afraid
of them. In such places, it is common to have heard stories in which someone
who was missing returns several days later thanks to an Evil Spirit's help.
"
Evil Vortex,"Even though Evil Vortices also participated in the Watcher War, many began to
call them that due to their appearance and peculiarities. All light around an Evil
Vortex is inevitably absorbed by it. Even on a bright morning with totally clear
skies, the space around an Evil Vortex somehow seems darker.
"
Exalted Spirit,"The only vulnerable parts of a Spirit are its hands and face, as steel and magic
simply go through its body.

If an Exalted Spirit finds someone living in poverty, it always offers food and
other presents to help them in their situation. Unfortunately, they sometimes
steal these gifts from other people, which often gives the story a sad and
violent ending.
"
Exiled Satyr,"The constant threat of the Ets forced the Satyrs to establish their colonies high
in the treetops. They prefer leafier, higher trees, and a good part of the Blood
Grove treetops have been settled by them.

Some Satyrs steal from their arachnid neighbors or illegally trade with them.
Those and other crimes are sometimes punished with exile, based on their
severity and the existence of repeat offenses. In addition, to prevent them from
joining anather colony and committing more misdeeds, both horns are cut off.
"
Experimental Clockwork,"The nation of Kiaces is located in the northern part of the continent, a long way
from Radia. There, steam technology has developed considerably, and its
inhabitants depend on it to a great extent.

The Experimental Clockwork was the last of its kind to be built by Alexandria,
and its sole purpose is to gather all kinds of information about the outside.
However, believing this creature is harmless can be a fatal mistake. Anyone
who interrupts its activities will automatically become a target to be eliminated,
unless the threat is clearly greater than its own strength, in which case it will try
to escape.
"
Eye Animation,"When a necromancer creates an Animation, the rest of the body that part
belonged to turns to dust after a few seconds. In addition, the size of the body
part increases considerably.

Necromancers who bring Eye Animations to life often place them outside their
lairs to keep an eye on the horizon, as their sharp vision allows them to see any
detail within three miles.
"
Faded Grimoire,"An ambitious prcject was carried out in the Columbia Tower to give life to
inanimate objects. Grimoires are the result of a long and tedious experiment
whose purpose was to create singular and extraordinary spells that would be
preserved for eternity.

It smells like old leather; its pages have been turned hundreds of times.
Anyone who opens the Faded Grimoire without taking the necessary
precautions will see their lifespan reduced every second.
"
Faith Hunter,"Hunters are nomadic creatures that travel around the world on the backs of
great wolves. The bond between the rider and its mount is established from a
young age, and they generally do not separate until one of them dies. All of
them follow the ideals of Meraxis, which are not too clear to most humans and
other intelligent species, and the God of Bliss grants them special powers in
exchange, like the Faith Hunter's ability to bring its allies back to life.
"
Fallen Carnage,"From the moment they were created, no other creature has managed to
replace the Carnages as the most efficient assassins there are. Crime
syndicates and some powerful businessmen often use them to get rid of loose
ends or competition.

For a Fallen Carnage, taking lives is as necessary as eating, sleeping or
reproducing, to the point of turning against their own allies if one of them steals
a kill.
"
Favored Masochist,"The Torture Chamber is an underground complex located in the kingdom of
Caedo, several acres in size. Some believe that Tartarith has altered its
dimensions to make it even bigger inside.

When a Masochist is idle, it inflicts superficial wounds on itself to kill time. It is
believed that the Favored Masochist was once a young northerner who could
channel curses into his own weapon.
"
Fearsome Gargantuan,"Torun has always been fascinated by mountains. One day, after giving life to
the Storms, he decided that it would be great if mountains could walk and insult
simple mortals, giving them intense looks of disapproval.

In some regions of Radia it is believed that the Fearsome Gargantuan's name
is due to the horns on its head. In reality, it was named by several warriors who
saw one curl into a ball and roll toward them at great speed.
"
Feeling Arbiter,"The world is full of intelligent creatures, and some stand out from the rest in
one or more respects. Many attract the attention of the Auditors but, because of
their behavior or their way of thinking, they are not considered suitable to carry
out their designs.

Unlike Moving Arbiters, Feeling Arbiters do not resolve conflicts by force. When
they intervene in an argument between two people, they sometimes decide to
cast a silencing spell on one of them if that person is not listening to what the
other one says.
"
Feet Animation,"Animations are obedient creatures, though they do not always fully understand
what they are told, and take any order literally.

On more than one occasion, a Feet Animation has begun to move as if it were
dancing for no apparent reason. It was quickly discovered that in all cases,
those feet had once belonged to someone who enjoyed dancing, either
professionally or as a hobby.
"
Feral Carver,"This devilish pest enjoys torturing its victims with its own hands, generally
ripping them open to eat their guts while they are still alive. It considers the
bloodstains on its body lucky charms and never cleans them up, even if it is its
own blood. That is why the scent of a Feral Carver is so characteristic, to the
point of serving as a warning to many adventurers when they are near one of
their lairs.
"
Feral Voidlord,"From his palace of stars, a God watched that dance of intrigue with a smile. A
short time later, several Gods lost valuable items that they had created.
Centuries after that, when the Unification War came to an end, Milner found the
Phase Rogue looting the royal crypts of Omnia. After stopping it, she realized
there was no body inside Cerys's grave.

Feral Voidlords only attack small villages. When they howl in the middle of the
night, a dark aura escapes from their jaws and blackens the sky, absorbing all
light from the moon and the stars. In their perfect cloaks of darkness, they
move toward their chosen victims, sometimes helpless and unwary, other
times aware that they will soon cease to exist.
"
Ferocious Fiend,"The first Fiends lived in the Great Pandemonium with Vulcanar. The God of
Fire was very satisfied with his creations, but he had no choice but to exile
most of them, as they would have eventually wiped out all other creatures in his
realm.

When a Ferocious Fiend cannot get close enough to bite its enemies, it uses
the pointed end of its tail to pierce through them. Some Carvers train young
Ferocious Fiends to use them as mounts and shock troops once they grow up.
"
Festering Ghoul,"Adter the defeat of King Sigmund, the survivors of Omnia fled the city, never to
return. Before that, Milner defeated Sigmund's right-hand man, a Mage of great
talent, in single combat. Due to his great power and the magic items he carried,
the transformation was not complete. Like other Ghouls, the Festering Ghoul
has lost his personality. However, it seems that he is able to direct other
Ghouls and control their insatiable hunger. The authorities are still trying to find
him to destroy him.
"
Festival Smog,"The Festival Smog is a creature originally designed for festive purposes. It was
developed in an illegal laboratory and it usually fetches a high price in the black
market. The Mage who directed the prcject was expelled from the Magic
University of Siralim years ago for performing illegal tests on intelligent
sukjects, and she was locked in a regular prison with anti-magic protection.
However, she managed to escape thanks to her contacts and started a new
life. The authorities are currently trying to track down her fraudulent activities
without much success.
"
Final Arbiter,"Arbiters are creatures who roam around, resolving minor disputes by order of
the Auditors. Sometimes they simply chat with one or more of the parties
involved.

Of all of them, the Final Arbiter is the one that intervenes the most in the affairs
of those with fewer resources, and the only one who does more than speak or
go into battle. Recently, a group of Final Arbiters was seen helping in the
reconstruction of a town in Neralim that had suffered an earthquake.
"
Fire Priest,"In the beginning, there were only eleven. They gave shape to the world, and life
to the beings that inhabit it. To do so, they sacrificed part of their power.

Fire Priests were the first of their species to visit the cities. Wherever they went,
like most other Priests, they seemed to make humans and creatures aware of
the injustices upon which their communities were built. They instantly
undermined the authority of many lords and stopped the damage their warriors
and Magi might have caused.
"
Fire Salamander,"The Nether Orbs that helped an old ruler of Siralim attain godhood also granted
the Salamanders extraordinary magic abilities.

Fire Salamanders like to make their nests in the Great Pandemonium. They
can walk on lava without harm, so they generally lay their eggs on islets
surrounded by this dangerous substance. If a flying creature tries to approach,
the Fire Salamander spits fire at it to knock it down, where it dies to the heat of
the magma. Vulcanar quickly became an admirer of these creatures.
"
Firewound Angel,"Adter the war against darkness, the Angels, creatures of blood and steel, lost
their purpose and became lethargic, until the wars of humans caught their
attention.

A former scientist and priest of Vanelin studied these creatures and discovered
that submerging them in water was enough to extinguish their flames that
cover their body. However, they only need a few seconds to make them burn
again. Those seconds were what the priest needed to run away before the
Firewound Angel turned him to ashes.
"
Flailing Manticore,"Manticores are agile, deadly creatures that can break a person's neck with a
single bite. However, the Flailing Manticore is different, as it prefers to use its
tail to inflict pain. A single blow of it can break limbs, pierce armor and crush
the skull of any creature.
"
Flamegrip Clutcher,"Before the first kingdoms existed, an individual was born who had an
exceptional talent for magic. His parents named him Taylor. As a child, he
mistreated his toys and experimented with living animals that he caught in the
woods, not caring at all about their suffering.

The Flamegrip Clutcher waits until its victims have been immobilized by
another Clutcher, then grabs their boots and sets them on fire. The victims
watch as their feet are burnt to a crisp, making escape impossible.
"
Flamehook Pilwiz,"The authorities of Rodia forbid the cultivation of corn to any species other than
the Pilwiz, due to the mysterious accidents that the competition would
otherwise suffer. In exchange, the Council of Economy has a say in the prices
of corn to prevent abuse.

The Flamehook Pilwiz is immune to the heat of fire. It has an essential job, as it
can absorb fire to save the crops if necessary. They sometimes come into
conflict with the Ents, as they burn forest plots to cultivate them.
"
Flametongue Efreet,"The Efreets were born from the fire and lava of the Great Pandemonium
through the work of Vulcanar and several Magi. Unlike Bjinns, these creatures
are not ambitious and never betray their owners, although they are quite
mischievous.

The Flametongue Efreet's control over fire is such that it can alter its properties,
so that instead of burning a creature it fills it with vigor and energy.
"
Flesh Abomination,"Abominations are weak-willed creatures who can be easily manipulated. Their
two heads communicate by babbling, usually at the same time, and they can
understand what other people are telling them. As most Abominations used to
be humans, they are easy prey for Ghouls and Forsaken in the wild.

Flesh Abominations often join small bands of criminals or big crime syndicates
that accept them in exchange for protection.
"
Flood Familiar,"Familiars are often hired by small towns and villages to scare away Mutated
Pulse Bats that try to take advantage of the darkness of the night to steal food
from people.

The Flood Familiar can swim and dive in the water, from where it can also
obtain food. In battle, it creates high-density water spheres that it can direct at
will to hit its opponents in unprotected areas.
"
Fog Spirit,"There are many legends surrounding the world's oceans. They speak of
curses, great treasures and unexplored lands. The story of the Fog Spirit goes
back to that of William James, a famous pirate who sailed the waters for
decades and discovered impossible places. His last journey took him to an
island that floated above the northern sea, where he found a magnificent
treasure. A cursed treasure. The Fog Spirit appeared when this happened, and
it has traveled the world since, breaking minor curses.
"
Foghorn Clockwork,"Over the years, the people of Kiaces and other nations, especially those that
are far from Rodia, have changed their lifestyle, adapting it to the advantages
steam technology provides.

Foghorn Clockworks camouflage themselves by standing mationless close to
the gears found throughout Damarel. Their purpose is to ensure everything
works correctly, and also to alert Battle Clockworks to the presence of
intruders. In any case, they are also capable of dealing with threats, which they
often do by letting themselves fall on them.
"
Forbidden Grimoire,"Although Grimoires can live forever, their structure is vulnerable to events
where a great amount of magic is unleashed. This has caused alterations in the
spells they contain after events such as the Unification War or the ascension to
godhaood of an old ruler of Siralim.

The Forbidden Grimoire once contained spells that could instantly kill whoever
cast them. That is why only the most skilled Magi can safely look at its pages
and read the letters, numbers and runes they contain.
"
Forest Gargantuan,"The size of a Gargantuan is both its greatest advantage and its weak point. On
the one hand, their incredible strength allows them to deliver devastating blows.
On the other, they are easy targets that can fall apart if their legs are damaged.

On the back of the Forest Gargantuan there is a small ecosystem inhabited
mainly by trees, insects and small birds. During battle, it uses the soil and the
rocks on the ground to regenerate any damage.
"
Forest Priest,"When humans and creatures populated the land, the first cities were born. But
it seemed like the children of the Gods would forever fight among themselves.

Priests are venerated as divine creatures in all of the kingdoms of Rodia.
Forests and their ecosystems have been affected by wars and other human
activities. The Forest Priests traveled to these places and spread their essence
to repopulate them. When they finished their work, some stayed behind to
prevent that from happening again.
"
Forsaken Bonescraper,"During the last battle of the Unification War, the people of Omnia who had lost
their lives suffered a monstrous transformation that affected them differently
depending on their sex. In the case of women, they became creatures that the
victors called Forsaken.

The strength of the Forsaken Bonescraper is unparalleled in this world. So
much that her body breaks down because of her own blows. When she can no
longer raise her arm, she attacks her enemies with the spikes on her shoulder.
"
Forsaken Plaguebearer,"During the siege of Omnia, several magic students were assigned to protect
the University. Shortly before the Unification forces achieved victory, the
Festering Ghoul entered the University followed by a hundred Ghouls. The
students soon realized there was nothing they could do. One locked herself in
the biological experimentation room, but the doors gave way and she was
killed. Her left arm is now a factory of diseases, although until now she had
remained in Omnia and her existence was unknown.
"
Forsaken Rotmongerer,"The Magic University of Omnia had the most cutting-edge studies and
research techniques in the world. When the Unification War came to an end,
the Forsaken and Ghouls infested the facilities, attracted by the smell of magic.

The Rotmongerer's fungi emit spores that absorb the vital energy of plant
organisms and send it to this creature.
"
Forsaken Scourgewalker,"The Forsaken are insatiable creatures that feed mainly on human flesh. Like
Ghouls, they have lost their minds and identities and have become tireless
killers that only steel and magic can stop.

The last battle of the Unification War caused serious damage to the city of
Omnia. It was soon on fire, and the women who died by the flames became
Scourgewalkers. When they find people, they turn the fire of their own bady into
spells to end their lives.
"
Forsaken Seacrawler,"The city of Omnia had engineering works that seemed to be taken from a
dream. The floating lake, where a large number of marine creatures were
displayed, was one of the most popular tourist attractions. During the
Unification War, the enchanted mechanisms that supported the lake were
damaged, and it began to move freely around the city. The women who
drowned inside transformed into Seacrawlers, creatures that can quickly move
underwater and drown anyone who comes into contact with them.
"
Forsaken Spinewhipper,"The physical strength of the Forsaken is immense. With their pincers, they can
stop the fist of a Giant and cut off its hand.

At the beginning of a fight, the Spinewhipper uses her tentacles to stimulate her
own spine with electric currents, increasing her speed considerably. She then
uses her spine to hit her enemies in the face or grab them by the arms so that
they cannot use their weapons.
"
Forsaken Swampdweller,"When the Forsaken and the Ghouls began to hunt the civilians of Omnia, there
was a massive flight to the upper levels of the city. To protect the upper
echelons, the city guard had a Minotaur Earthshaker destroy the last steps of
the famous glass stairs. Hundreds of people lost their lives, and the women
who were crushed became Swampdwellers. When they fight in a magic
environment, they plant their tentacles on the ground to absorb the energy and
strengthen themselves.
"
Fortune Dragon,"This creature's name is cruelly ironic. When the claws of a Fortune Dragon
pierce an enemy's flesh, they transmit an infectious disease that is lethal if left
untreated for twenty-four hours. Dragon Queens usually have them attack any
outsiders who break the laws of the Unsullied Meadows, leaving them alive.
This is meant to serve as a warning due to the extreme pain the victims suffer
during the course of the disease.
"
Frenzy Ghoul,"All those who drank of Omnia's water three days before the attack were struck
by a curse that remained inside them in a latent state.

Ghouls are always hungry and feel an intense predilection toward human flesh.
To subdue their victims, Frenzy Ghouls rarely begin by biting them. Instead,
they take advantage of the incredible strength of their left arm to beat them to
death. Only then will they start eating.
"
Friden,"The oceans hide many mysteries. In them lie innumerable treasures, lost
islands full of unimaginable riches, and terrible curses. They gave rise to
incredible stories and legends. People, especially pirates, believed in the sea
as a deity. In some way, their faith and the magic hidden in the depths of the
waters gave life to Friden. The God of the Sea enjoys stories about the courage
of adventurers, and often communicates with them to encourage them, give
them advice and acknowledge their feats.
"
Frost Phoenix,"Phoenixes are majestic, elusive creatures that rarely interact with other beings.

It is said that in the past, a Royal Phoenix fell seriously ill and landed on the
Frostbite Caverns. Azural approached full of curiosity and watched as the
creature burst into flames and was consumed. The young God knelt and
carefully put his hand in its ashes. He felt the touch of two tiny legs and a gentle
peck. Surprised, he pushed the ashes away and looked at the Frost Phoenix
chick he had accidentally created.
"
Frostbite Cruncher,"When the ruler of Nex discussed Crunchers with llberd, and proposed that they
were simply made by Vertraag as a joke, llberd denied the possibility saying
that if they were Vertraag's, no Carbuncle would have survived for so long.

When a Frostbite Cruncher is afraid or angry, it emits a howl reminiscent of the
sound of a blizzard. Its shell lights up and a thin layer of ice spreads out on the
ground.
"
Frostbite Wight,"He was the scourge of the icy mountains near Sithicus long before Misery,
Egas and other dark lords even existed. When the blizzards lifted snow and
frost from the ground, he fell on his enemies wrapped in a blanket of cold white
and blood red. It was believed that Azural had sent him to cover the entire
kingdom in ice. However, the Queen of Sithicus foresaw his movements and
managed to sabotage his descent by provoking a huge avalanche. Now, he
and his castle belong to the Kingdom of Heretics.
"
Frostbite Yeti,"This creature can channel the cold of the Frostbite Caverns through its blows to
freeze its prey. It is a peaceful creature that lives in the snow and does not look
for trouble, but faced with the arrival of explorers that are scared by its
presence and hunters who seek its skin, it often has to look for allies to get by.
At times, it is deceived by other creatures into forming a group, and at nightfall
they end its life to get some money out of its coat.
"
Frostfire Efreet,"Zonte had a bad feeling about Vulcanar's intentions from the beginning. He had
dealt with the God before, and he knew it was no coincidence that he had
appeared with such an offer immediately after the Djinn uprising. Zonte twisted
his words to create the Frostfire Efreet. This creature's breath can freeze any
surface, and its touch can cause ice burns on the skin. Vulcanar had no choice
but to reluctantly exile this Efreet from the Great Pandemonium.
"
Frozen Spirit,"The Frozen Spirit is almost as old as Azural. When the Magi of Sithicus began
to investigate the Frostbite Caverns, this creature appeared. Many lost
travelers and explorers found their way when they were lucky enough to find it.
When someone tends to the wounds of an ally, this creature can turn the
healing magic into a thick layer of ice that protects against blows.
"
Gateway Shade,"It is rare to see a Shade near towns or cities, since they are greatly disturbed
by the presence of souls, except those that were tainted by their previous
selves.

Gateway Shades come from creatures that used magic at some point of their
lives. When they feel threatened, they create a small spatial distortion to
teleport behind their enemies and attack them by surprise.
"
Genaros,"In the distant kingdom of Kiaces, hunting was revered for dozens of
generations, so much so that its cult spread beyond its borders. That faith that
traveled almost the entire continent gave life to Genaros, a God who, far from
being vengeful, even extolled indiscriminate slaughter as long as it had the
purpose of filling the stomach of another living being. However, over time he
was forgotten and the borders of his realm simply ceased to be seen with the
naked eye. Recently, a group of Radian Magi found a way to enter the
Overgrown Temple, causing that mist to disappear. Genaros is always talking
about hunting and does not tolerate any type of violence that is not related to
survival in the strictest sense of the word. He charges with all his anger against
any criminal who enters his realm.
"
Geylian Ophan,"These creatures were imbued with a large amount of magic, and seven Nether
Orbs were consumed in the process of their creation.

The Goddess of Illusion had to ask Vertraag for help so that Surathli could
create the Geylian Ophan. It can see the past and the immediate future at once
through its secondary eyes, and its power allows it to generate small time
distortions that seem to accelerate anything inside of them.
"
Ghoul Ringleader,"This creature's left hand allows it to absorb water from any organism, although
the process is not instantaneous. Some crime syndicates use this creature as a
form of torture, having it dry out their enemies limb from limb. To the delight of
many, a spell was developed centuries ago that can reverse the damage done
by this terrifying ability.
"
Giant Mangler,"Yseros's advice had been to create small, elusive creatures to face the
Watchers, which was more than enough reason for Torun to do the opposite.

The Giant Mangler is the only one of its kind that does not use strictly blunt
weapons, though it usually uses the hooks of its club to climb to the roofs, then
leap on its enemies.
"
Gift Mimic,"Two hundred years ago, the dean of the Magic University of Neralim received a
gift from one of her colleagues for Purple Victory Day. When she opened it, she
was greeted by two dreadful rows of fangs and devoured in a single bite before
she could react. The next morning her colleague was provisionally appointed
as dean; a position she managed to keep for ten years, which at the time was
the longest possible term of deanship, established to prevent such practices.
"
Gimp Mummy,"During the funeral of a sovereign of Kaito, a sacred conclave was held in which
all priests and priestesses participated. Through words and a strange dance,
the dust rose from the ground and flew around them.

The Gimp Mummies led the attack on the capital of Kaito. The royal guard was
terrified to realize that, after being hit by these creatures, the wounds they
inflicted with their weapons were reflected in their own bodies.
"
Glade Watcher,"Adter crossing the portal, Watchers took on different appearances to adapt to
their environment.

The Glade Watcher stands next to trees and bushes and closes its eyes to
camouflage itself. When someone passes by, it lets out a sinister giggle and
lets its fangs show. If that individual dares to approach, it opens its eyes wide
and attacks with a terrible bite.
"
Gloopdiator,"Venedon spent hundreds of years trying to bring the Concoctions to life, but
given his lack of scientific knowledge, these creatures are quite simple-looking.

It is plain to see that the Gloopdiator knows very well what it is doing. It
employs elaborate tactics such as feints in battle, and it learns from its own
mistakes. One of its favorite strategies is to trick its opponents with its shield,
intentionally leaving an opening so the enemy causes a direct wound to its
body. Then, the Gloopdiator strikes its enemy's head, dropping its mace on
their skull.
"
Glutinous Slime,"The Slimes have different abilities depending on the type of magic that
generated the waste they came from.

The Glutinous Slime's body acts as a catalyst for spells. Although absorbing
spells can damage its structure, it does not seem to mind, and always
intercepts them to channel their energy and share it with its allies, making them
more powerful.
"
Gold Golem,"This creature was not designed for war, but to protect the belongings of a
wealthy merchant who wanted to punish anyone foolish enough to rob him. Any
living being wha touches this Golem will suffer excruciating pain throughout the
body for three days. For the rest of the thief's life, trying to steal from anyone
will cause them to suffer anather episode. Nowadays, everyone knows the
story and thieves simply ignore such Golems.
"
Goldblight Angel,"This creature continually gives off a powerful light that can make anyone who
looks at it closely lose their mind. The scope of the effect depends on the time
of exposure, but this has not stopped some kings and ostentatious lords from
using these creatures as lamps for their castles and mansions. Naturally, many
of these lords end up paying dearly for their bizarre boldness in mental
hospitals.
"
Goliath Arachnalisk,"Although its poison is not lethal, the Goliath Arachnalisk is the largest of its
siblings. It lives deep in forests and tends to avoid clearings, which is why
forest-dwelling Familiars usually settle in them. This creature is a born hunter
that attacks any creature of similar or smaller size even when it is not hungry,
as its web can preserve food for several days.
"
Gonfurian,"The God of War delights in the conflicts that constantly plague the world. He
always acknowledges warlike feats, and far from being satisfied with
congratulating the great warriors of history, he grants them immortality and the
power to fight for eternity as his Chosen. Sometimes, he lets himself be found
by certain warriors in hopes of being challenged to a duel. However, until the
arrival of the current ruler of Siralim, no one had managed to defeat him.
"
Gooarrior,"Concoctions leave behind them a trail of highly polluting, glowing, sticky
substance. It is believed that, if one of these creatures were thrown into a river,
entire ecosystems and crops would be ruined for a long time.

To intimidate its enemies, the Gooarrior constantly alters its shape. The truth
is, this creature tries very hard to assume a terrifying appearance, but its
success rate is questionable, as the only thing it provokes in its opponents is
laughter.
"
Gore Abomination,"Abominations keep some parts of their true identity, although they have lost
most of their memories. Both heads can access the other's mind to know what
they think at all times.

When the God of Punishment is in a hurry to create more Abominations, the
result is usually a Gore Abomination. This creature has an unusual amount of
blood in it, which erupts from its body when it receives damage.
"
Goretongue Gargoyle,"Marette, the dean of the Magic University of Undolim, researched for decades
to find a way to give life to inanimate oktjects. Her prcject finally succeeded a
few years before the Unification War began.

The Magi of Undolim gave the Goretongue Gargoyle its name because of its
extraordinary ability. This creature has an exceptional control over magic: as
long as there is blood on its tongue, it is able to cast spells indefinitely.
"
Gorgon Gazer,"Many Gorgons have given up trying to integrate into society due to the
treatment they have received in Rodia, and they have established colonies in
the Cutthroat Jungle.

The Gorgon Gazer can predict her opponent's movements with her eyes,
though she needs to keep her concentration. They are also able to see in the
dark, so they are always assigned the night watches.
"
Gorgon Sorceress,"The Gorgons come from a country where the use of magic is restricted and
beyond the reach of non-humans.

Gorgon Sorceresses are the most well versed in magic of their kind, and they
have learned fast on account of the books they borrow from the Familiars of the
Cornell Tower. Thanks to their knowledge, they have learned to prolong their
enemies’ fear by just staring at them.
"
Gorgon Trickster,"When the genocide forced the Gorgons to abandon their home, the Trickster
earned Gonfurian's favor for devising a plan to deceive the human generals
and escape their lands. The only hope for her kind was to take over the naval
fleet, guarded by a fearsome garrison of warriors. She connected her essence
to her sisters’ and created the illusion of a meteor shower to make them flee in
disarray. The plan worked, but her boldness cost her her sight. Now she is the
undisputed leader of her people.
"
Gorgon Witch,"Like Gorgon Sorceresses, Witches have benefited from Rodia's lack of rules
restricting the use of magic. These Gorgons have managed to combine the
power of their gaze with that of Spell Gems, and they are able to utilize both at
once without difficulty. In their free time, they make copies of the magic books
borrowed from the Familiars, so they can return them and obtain new ones
completely free of charge.
"
Gorlum Tremor,"When the battle between Misery and the ruler of Siralim came to an end, this
creature emerged from the throne room in the ruins of Caedo's castle, where
they had fought their duel. This creature is visible even in the deepest
darkness. The earth trembles constantly around it even when it is not moving. If
it hits the ground with its hands, it can cause large-scale earthquakes that
shake buildings miles away from where it is.
"
Gorum Apocalypse,"The Goddess of Illusion knew perfectly well that trying to convince Torun to do
what she said was a complete waste of time. However, she would not let
Vulcanar get away with it as easily. Unbeknownst to Vulcanar, Yseros made
some madifications to the Gorum Apocalypses while they were being created.
Although their appearance is as fearsome as that of their sisters, the Gorum
devour any diseases and curses afflicting their allies as if they were an
afternoon snack.
"
Granite Golem,"Granite Golems hate Magi and everything related to them. Even though they
are quite loyal to their masters, it can be dangerous for a Mage to own one, as
their instincts can provoke the occasional outburst that usually results in
property damage. On the other hand, whenever a magical accident causes
damage to a town, this creature always appears to help rebuild it.
"
Grave Leper,"Centuries ago, the Death Magi of the Magic University of Nex developed a
complex ritual that madified the structure of a Leper. The result is a creature
that can literally absorb corpses through its skin. It can slightly increase its
power in this way, provided the corpses are fresh. After a while, the skeletons
of the absorbed creatures emerge from its body and fall off.
"
Gravebane Wight,"Wights are native to the Kingdom of Heretics, but since King Misery rose up in
arms against Siralim, they have spread throughout the country to sow chaos.

The Gravebane Wight earned its name after a skirmish in the Valley of Herces,
located in the deepest part of the Unsullied Meadows, in which it destroyed the
mausoleum where the most famous warriors who gave their lives for the
unification of Rodia were buried.
"
Gravekeeper,"Although most undead feed on living creatures, necromancy has taken many
turns throughout its development. A Death Mage who fought alongside King
Misery carried out a prcject to create zombies capable of feeding on dead
creatures as well. Thus, when the living put up too much resistance,
Gravekeepers had only to dig out a grave to satisfy their hunger.
"
Gravewood Ghost,"Mount Hyvana was the site of one of the first battles of the Unification War.
Vanelin's army wiped out the enemy in a matter of minutes, literally reducing
them to ashes and severed limbs. After the victory of the Vanelites, they
ordered the bodies to be buried. When the war ended, the daughter of one of
these soldiers used the residual magic from the battle to cast a powerful spell
meant to bring the dead back to life.
"
Grenale,"Because of their inexpressiveness, it may seem like Grenales do not
understand what the people around them are saying; but in truth they are great
listeners. They especially enjoy stories of battles and adventures, but when a
Grenale hears something particularly unpleasant, it often gets upset and
explodes, coating everyone around it in beer. Owners of these creatures
usually apologize claiming that Grenales cannot control their explosions, but
this is absolutely not true.
"
Greybeard,"These dogs are the guardians of an order of Magi from the kingdom of Ercath.
Their cloaks and staves are their hallmarks, and they have been infused with
magic in such a way that they have acquired certain peculiarities. They are
capable of finding any member of the order as long as they are within a ten
miles radius, and they perceive the presence of intruders within their
headquarters from the moment they set foot inside it. At that moment, the pack
goes on the attack while barking to alarm the members of the order.
"
Griffon Archer,"Griffons sometimes establish bonds with other intelligent creatures. In the past,
there was a Hunter who found a Griffon chick that had been abandoned by its
flock due to the black color of its feathers. The Hunter raised the chick and
taught it how to use a bow when it grew up. Together they wandered Rodia,
facing innumerable dangers until, one day, the adventurer passed away due to
old age. The Griffon Archer still flies over the country, fighting injustice
single-mindedly.
"
Griffon Divebomber,"Although Griffons cannot speak like humans and other creatures, they are very
intelligent and form societies of their own.

Any heavy object is a weapon for the Griffon Divebombers, and they always
carry some with them. They fly above their enemies during battle, taking
advantage of any distractions their allies create to drop something on their
heads.
"
Griffon Dreamfinder,"Finding a Griffon nest is extremely hard, as they usually choose high,
inaccessible places to lay eggs and feed their chicks. Therefore, their eggs are
considered a delicacy in Rodia, and the people in the upper echelons of society
often pay a fortune to obtain them. If, in spite of the difficulties, someone
manages to steal several eggs, a Griffon Dreamfinder may track that person
down, as they are capable of detecting the presence of their relatives at great
distances.
"
Griffon Screecher,"The Griffons have learned much from humans and other creatures through
observation. The knowledge they have gained includes the handling of
weapons or using the cold to preserve food, and it is always passed on to
subsequent generations.

The Griffon Screecher's screams inspire dread and can cause temporary
deafness with prolonged exposure.
"
Griffon Veteran,"When a Griffon reaches a certain age, it usually retires to live a calmer life.
However, some never tire of battle and continue fighting until their last breath.
Most of these Griffons are scarred and have lost limbs, but that does not stop
them from taking flight and waging as much war as they did in their youth.
"
Grom'Met,"When criminals started visiting the Amalgam Gardens, T'mere M'rgo decided
to create Grom'Met so he could help him give life to the creatures who would
defend his realm. He is very talkative and a prankster, and he gets along well
with the God of Fusion, although sometimes he can be too much for T'mere,
who asks him to shut up. He sometimes goes too far with his pranks as
well—for example, he once played dead after fighting a bunch of criminals.
T'mere knew perfectly well that he was alive, but did not find it amusing and
stopped talking to him for two weeks.
"
Grovewalker,"A greedy, unscrupulous businessman from Siralim hired the services of a
Death Mage a few months ago to corrupt some creatures who were protecting
a forest to the south. The result was the Grovewalker, a fiendish being who
wanders without conscience, withering everything it touches, spreading disease
wherever it goes. The businessman and the Death Mage were caught and
imprisoned, and work is currently under way to eliminate these creatures from
the ecosystem, with satisfactory results.
"
Grubette,"These creatures inhabit a series of hidden tunnels found in the Arachnid Nest
and, as with the Nix, males of this species are prohibited from leaving their
home. Females are exceptional hunters and their preferred prey is the
Arachnalisks. It is not uncommon for Grubettes to leave the Arachnid Nest, but
when they do they only visit large cities to trade with other creatures. Since they
do not have vocal cords, they communicate with other intelligent species
through hand gestures. Once they finish trading, they immediately return home.
"
Gruesome Gargantuan,"Precious minerals are a Gargantuan's favorite food, although they usually eat
all kinds of ordinary rocks. These creatures will fight for any cause if promised a
nice helping of quartz. The Watcher War ravaged many human towns and
cities, but also some settlements of other intelligent creatures that lived in the
mountains. Torun did not take this into account and the result was the
Gruesome Gargantuan. Magic acts unpredictably around it, and manifests
spontaneously to damage its enemies.
"
Gula Sin,"Sins are the counterpart of Sanctuses, as well as their quintessential nemeses.
When two of them meet they completely lose control, and a catastrophic battle
ensues that devastates their surroundings due to their great power.

The Gula Sin likes to sneak into lavish banquets and leave one of its pieces of
meat on a tray. If someone bites it, that person will not be able to stop eating,
even if sated, until all the nearby food is gone.
"
Hammer Lord,"The Smiths’ arrival in what is now Radia supposed a revolution in the field of
blacksmithing, as their methods and materials were groundbreaking for the
time. During the Unification War, King Misery enslaved all of Caedo's Smiths to
produce weapons, armor and artifacts without rest. Many of them died of
exhaustion, but that did not stop the Last King of Caedo, who began to kidnap
Smiths from other kingdoms, and even offered a bounty to anyone who brought
him one.
"
Hand Animation,"If an Animation takes damage, the necromancer who created it will feel a
shooting pain in the same part of the body the Animation was made from.

When a Hand Animation spends too much time idle, their fingers begin to tap
against the surface they are on. On one occasion, a necromancer who was in
the Great Pandemonium watched as one of these creatures was consumed by
the lava when it carried out this movement.
"
Hanyac Tremor,"The forested mountains of Neralim were the scene of vicious battles during the
Watcher War, thousands of years before it became a kingdom. When it was all
over, some of those mountains seemed to decide it was time to get up and
leave.

Summers in Neralim can be harsh due to the extreme heat and infrequent
rains. When the vegetation starts to suffer, the Hanyac Tremor carries water
from the rivers to help the forests of the kingdom.
"
Harpy Eyegouger,"Harpies are intelligent creatures that since the dawn of human civilization have
brought disaster wherever their wings have taken them.

As its name indicates, the Harpy Eyegouger loves extracting the eyes of its
victims and is an expert at it. When its work is finished, it shows its trophies to
anyone nearby and eats them without mercy.
"
Harpy Hag,"Every town hall in Rodia offers a reward for the corpse of a Harpy, so they risk
getting killed if they approach a town.

The flight of the Harpy Hag is erratic and very difficult to predict, thanks to its
experience. When an opponent tries to adopt a defensive position, this creature
charges from any direction and performs a feint at the last moment, which
usually interrupts the enemy's action.
"
Harpy Marauder,"Harpies always need to be cautious when they attack a settlement. In general,
they only approach civilization when they want to sow chaos, since everyone
tries to kill them. Even so, few Harpies manage to survive for long.

The Harpy Marauder is a very cunning Harpy Hag that has managed to survive
longer than any other. It is considered a calamity by the government of Rodia,
as its incursions are rarely thwarted. Naturally, the reward for its head is a small
fortune.
"
Harpy Pillager,"Harpies are fully aware that they carry numerous diseases, deadly to humans
and other creatures. On more than one occasion, entire cities have succumbed
to their perverse plans.

Harpy Pillagers are the greatest danger to sailors who navigate the seas. They
have learned how to wield knives and are especially skilled at cutting the ropes
that hold the sails of boats. When a group of Harpies attacks a settlement or a
caravan, these creatures are tasked with taking the loot.
"
Harpy Queen,"Due to the constant persecution to which Harpies have been subjected for
thousands of years, they have become especially ingenious when it comes to
choosing a place to build their nests. Stony islets, high mountain peaks, or old
Arachnalisk nests are usually safe options.

The Queen, who is usually the oldest Harpy, is obeyed and fed by the others.
Although its only duty is to decide the next place in which to sow chaos, its
perverse instincts prevent it from staying in the nest without helping.
"
Harpy Screamer,"Harpy nests have always been a target for humans and other intelligent
creatures. The guards who are stationed day and night on town walls and
guard posts always keep a watchful eye for the arrival of these creatures.

The Harpy Screamer constantly emits a shuddering shriek. Anyone who hears
it up close risks losing their mind for a few seconds. For this reason, Harpy
hunters can be recognized by the earplugs that always hang around their necks.
"
Harpy Torturer,"For a time, it was believed that Harpies stole gold and precious stones because
they were attracted to shiny objects. A sailor discovered that in reality they feel
indifference toward these oktjects, as he saw these creatures toss them into the
sea.

Rarely do the victims of a Harpy Torturer lose their lives. These creatures
rejoice in the suffering of others, cutting skin with their sharp claws and pecking
at the soft parts. Before leaving, they rip the fingers off both hands from their
victims.
"
Haunted Golem,"The creature that haunts this Golem is fully self-aware. Tormented at being
trapped in this body, it desperately tries to make the Golem die in battle so that
it can be free. It seems to have developed a peculiar hatred of mirrors.
"
Headless Wight,"‘When nightborne mist shrouds the moon's palest eye

In colder days with no warmth from the sky

Travel not late my friend, and not alone

The horseman walks, to rend your flesh from bone!

No head he needs, nor eyes to see your fear

By wicked laughter you will know he's near

One axe blow will be the last thing you see

Before he departs, laughing cruelly""

- Seasonal folk song by Undolim's famous songstress Nieve Frost
"
Heart Luckmantria,"Adter the Uraloses began to trade with Rodia, Luckmantrias began to spread on
the forests of Neralim and other places. However, their expansion is very
limited, due to the very specific conditions their eggs need to hatch.

Heart Luckmantrias are usually found near flowers, and are constantly
accompanied by pollinating insects. If something threatens the Luckmantria,
these insects will go on the attack, especially those with stingers.
"
Heartminder,"Fed up with greed, selfishness and other common human attributes, four Magi
from the Tergath kingdom decided to take matters into their own hands. They
took initiatives to help the underprivileged, using magic to create infrastructures
in order to give jobs and food to as many people as possible. In addition, they
promoted progressive protests, but the Queen who reigned there did not
support their activities. With the army against them, they were finished.
Surrounded by ten of the eleven platoons, they performed a ritual. Their will
would not end that day. Thus, they sacrificed their lives and the Heartminder
was born, a creature who carried their legacy and who would take whatever
actions were necessary to help all who were oppressed by selfishness and
opulence.
"
Heavenshield Construct,"A few wealthy citizens have already acquired one or more of these creatures to
dispense with the services of butlers, as they require no salary.

The Heavenshield Construct can open its armor and let a creature close to its
size inside. In this way, these creatures have managed to save thousands of
civilians and wounded soldiers during Siralim's attacks by moving them to a
safe place. llberd has not ruled out having different sizes of these Constructs
built in the near future.
"
Helianthus Fae,"On one occasion, the ruler of a kingdom north of the Bronze Sea sent
hundreds of his sutjects there with the order to cut down the Yataka, a
mysterious tree that dwells within. Few made it back alive, but they said it gave
off a powerful light with every blow of the ax and received no damage.

Helianthus Fae are able to stay awake for a whole week without sleeping,
which is why they are chosen to stand guard at the Fae Lands.
"
Helios,"These creatures inhabit multiple lakes and rivers in Rodia, and feed mostly on
aquatic plants. However, they are able to survive on the surface, and in times
of drought they resort to feeding on shrubs and weeds. Bears and wolves see
Helios as potential prey when there is a lack of food, although it is not easy for
them to catch one. They are elusive and can feel the vibrations of footsteps
around them, so they almost always flee before any of these predators can
even approach.
"
Hell Hound,"At first, the Hounds were domestic creatures, but unfortunately, there are
always those who choose to abandon their faithful friends. Luckily, Hounds are
perfect hunters with great adaptability that always find a place in any
ecosystem.

Although the Hell Hound's fiery breath is a powerful weapon, what makes it
really dangerous are its magical abilities to strengthen the pack through a
mystical union.
"
Hell Watcher,"Watchers come from a mysterious dimension, which no mortal can access.

The Hell Watcher's innate abilities allow it to channel the energy of the undead
to enhance their spells. When they corner a creature, they dig their claws into
its flesh and take flight, then drop it from a high enough altitude to kill it.
"
Hemlock Ent,"Whenever there is a flood or some other natural disaster, Ents act to help
animals in danger and prevent the most fragile trees from breaking due to
extreme weather.

The Hemlock Ent traps defenseless animals during these events and hides
them inside its mouth or among its branches to prevent them from dying or
getting injured.
"
Hemomancer Devourer,"Hexilo and River were two great Magi who clashed for more than a decade.
When they were recruited by the Auditors, they gave up their old plans and
their rivalry to serve a common goal. Over the years, they forged a solid
friendship, though not one without derision and sarcasm.

Through the veins of the Hemomancers, executors of Mortem, the Titan's
blood runs... as well as the God's. The Hemomancer Devourer only feeds on
the blood of other creatures, and in doing so it can sift through the memories of
the creature from which it has fed.
"
Hemomancer Donor,"Before he worked for the Auditors as Twilight, Hexilo was a necromancer who
terrorized an entire nation close to what is now known as Rodia. Thanks to his
knowledge of magic and medicine, he found a way to alter and even control
others through their blood.

Hemomancers are straightforward creatures of few words that are rarely
influenced by other species.

If a Hemomancer Donor puts a certain amount of its blood into another
creature's veins, it is able to control all its movements, overriding their will for
as long as the substance remains in their system.
"
Hemomancer Lord,"River, who would later be known as Midnight, prevented the necromancer from
destroying several kingdoms with his experiments. Although Hexilo was not
motivated by power or wealth, but by knowledge, his methods were as ethical
as one can expect from a necromancer.

Any Hemomancer can know how healthy a creature is just by touching their
blood.

Hemomancer Lords specialize in military strategy and lead these creatures in
battle, often remaining behind. They are able to see what any of their kind
sees, transmit order through telepathy, and even forcefully control their
movements.
"
Hemomancer Seer,"It was in fact the appearance of the Voidlords that finally proved something was
not quite right, though the Auditors were already aware of this. These terrible
creatures were moving from the void into the Itherian Realms, and from there
entering the world created by the Gods.

When a Hemomancer tastes another creature's blood, it can tell whether they
are telling the truth for twenty-four hours. In addition, Hemomancer Seers can
read blood splatters to see everything that happened for an hour after the
substance was spilled.
"
Herbling,"This creature's roots are not entirely visible unless magic is used. They stretch
out a great distance beyond what the eye can see, and cling to the creature's
allies. In this way, it receives nourishment when they act, gaining power for a
limited time. However, this creature is extremely hard to breed and needs
proper care to even survive longer than a few days, so many biologists already
consider this species extinct.
"
Heretic Crusader,"This creature is not really a Crusader, but an automaton created by the
Auditors to protect Ubi Concordia. When it detects an enemy, the green lights
on its neck blink in a random order. When it is active for a long time, the metal
plates on its back get so hot that you could fry an egg on them. Indeed, if the
creature does not stop to cool down in a timely manner, it will shut down to
prevent damage to its structure.
"
Heretic Hunter,"Heretic Hunters are an exception within their culture in regard to the faith they
choose to profess. They usually worship a Chaos God, though in no case are
they repudiated by their own, to the surprise of the scholars of non-human
societies. They are silent, bloodthirsty warriors who take advantage of the
powers bestowed by the deities they worship, as well as their bond with the
group to enhance their blows.
"
Hidden Grimoire,"During the Apollinaire incident in the Columbia Tower, a famous Mage started
an experiment to save his own life. He succeeded in transferring his soul to a
book, though it took some time for him to accept his new life. For several
centuries he continued his studies in the tower, until the unexpected arrival of
the Familiars. Accustomed to his new life, the Hidden Grimoire welcomed
Washburn and her kind. He still lives with the Familiars in this tower, which they
renamed Cornell in his honor.
"
Hoar Shade,"When a Shade is seriously injured, it needs to stay within a surface and recover
energy or it will disappear.

Seven hundred years ago, a group of mercenaries managed to catch an
infamous band of looters. After their execution, nineteen Hoar Shades instantly
appeared, about half of the band. They quickly armed themselves with their old
sabers and attacked the population. Since that day, executions in Siralim take
place far from the capital.
"
Holiday Spirit,"Holiday Spirits have no color or shine for most of the year and can be mistaken
for a suspicious-looking bush. During the winter festivities, however, they regain
their vitality and quickly travel to the nearest town or village, no matter how
densely populated. There they fly among the crowd, wearing a permanent
smile. Rodians greatly enjoy the display when many of these creatures gather.
"
Holy Crusader,"Ever since humans and other intelligent creatures erected temples in honor of
Surathli, the Holy Crusaders have protected their gates. These creatures,
usually in pairs, remain immobile in front of them for hours, days, or weeks,
until something threatens the temple. Outsiders often confuse them with
statues or simply do not believe the stories, and eventually end up committing
a crime in their eyes.

As soon as a Holy Crusader lifts its mace, it is too late to run away.
"
Holy Wight,"Some warriors of Surathli protect her designs too vehemently. Many go astray
and commit atrocities in the name of Light. A few of these warriors, consumed
by rage at not having accomplished their goals, remain in this world even after
losing their lives. They are known as Holy Wights, bloodthirsty creatures who
are unable to distinguish between good and evil.
"
Horror Hound,"Many lords and mercenaries keep these creatures as pets or companions, but
their real strength lies in being with their pack. The authorities recommend
fleeing when faced with several of these creatures.

The Horror Hound's tail ends in a stinger that produces a torrent of fear and
sadness when it digs into the flesh of its enemies, weakening their strength and
resolve during battle.
"
Huanglong,"These creatures often take human forms to observe the daily life that takes
place in Rodia and other nations. However, they never interact with anyone or
bother to learn any languages. They just enjoy watching people, especially
when they are happy. In their dragon form they only interact with other dragons,
and often promote peaceful attitudes. Indeed, on many occasions they receive
visits from one or more dragons who seek their help to settle their differences.
However, a few of them end up following dark paths after witnessing the greed
and selfishness of other species.
"
Humanitas Sanctus,"Spielrein and Baker shared the same principles, and together they started the
Sanctus prcject. Its purpose was to create a creature that could punish Sins
and correct the wicked. For this, they needed the power of the Nether Orbs and
the items that the Sins carry in their hands.

The Humanitas Sanctus forces arrogant people to spend the rest of their lives
serving their neighbor whenever they can, even if it endangers their own lives.
"
Humilitas Sanctus,"Together, Spielrein and Baker traveled the different kingdoms, guided by
rumors about where Sins had manifested. Thanks to their skill as Magi, they
managed to defeat the seven deadly Sins, and they gathered the fourteen
items they needed.

It is uncommon to hear bleating in the large cities of Rodia. That is why panic
ensues whenever the sound is heard. If a Humilitas Sanctus enters a city with
two sheep on its hands, it never leaves it without having three.
"
Hunter Director,"In every group of Hunters there is always a leader, whom the scholars of
non-human societies call the Hunter Director. They are always the bravest
members of the group and masters of the shuriken, although they still need the
support of their own kind. They charge at their enemies’ front lines and throw
their shurikens while attacking with their swords. As if it were a dance, their
companions return the throwing weapon with strikes of their own, destroying
their enemies in a matter of seconds.
"
Hunter Scout,"Hunter groups seem to move without any concrete goals. However, on rare
occasions they travel Rodia with the purpose of fighting injustice. Such groups
are always led by a Hunter who, instead of a shuriken, wields a bow and arrows
made of the metal of its old throwing weapon. Some scholars of non-human
societies have determined that it symbolizes their decision to abandon their old
life. Others say that it is a custom handed down from generation to generation.
"
Hurricane,"Storms can speak, and they do it all the time, shouting vulgarities over the
constant sound of thunder they emit. In addition, they usually electrocute food
while it is cooking, trying to compete with the fire to see who can make it boil
faster.

When a Hurricane gets angry, it discharges enough electricity to pulverize
creatures the size of a horse, although it prefers inanimate targets like the
wheels of a carriage, stores of magic items, and, of course, chimneys.
"
Hydra,"Hydras protect large bastions that Vulcanar had built in Great Pandemonium a
long time ago. The Gad of Fire created these creatures with the purpose of
attracting adventurers and bounty hunters, who expect something valuable to
be hidden in a building guarded by such a large creature. The first time
someone managed to reach the depths of one of these fortresses, he found a
chest with a note inside, which simply said 'Sucker'.
"
Hydrangea Fae,"The magic that protects Yataka prevents it from taking any damage from
blows, cuts, or spells. Indeed, not even a God could harm it. However, a study
conducted recently at the Magic University of Vanelin established that a force
powerful enough could destroy it. The Hydrangea Fae's wings glow in the dark,
so they have a much harder time making a surprise attack at night. For this
reason, they tend to hide in the leafy treetops, plummeting from the heights on
their enemies.
"
Hysteria Ghoul,"When the civilians and soldiers of Omnia lost their lives during the siege, their
bodies underwent a brutal transformation. Men and women were affected
differently. In the case of men, they became creatures that the victors later
called Ghouls.

When a Hysteria Ghoul finds a target to devour, the irrepressible urge to do so
can be transmitted to the warriors around him. Sometimes, even herbivore
creatures end up biting off flesh.
"
Ice Salamander,"Most Ice Salamanders live in the Frostbite Caverns. When they cannot find a
hollow space in the ice in which ta lay their eggs, they periodically freeze the
rock with their powerful breath to help them develop successfully. When these
creatures reach maturity, they leave behind a slippery trail of solid ice.
Sometimes, many young Ice Salamanders can be seen following an adult one,
sliding merrily on the frozen ground.
"
Icemane Yeti,"When an Icemane Yeti leaves the Frostbite Caverns, it leaves a characteristic
trail of frost behind it that warns travelers of its presence. It is not excessively
dangerous by itself, but it is better to avoid them when they travel with other
kinds of Yetis, since its mere presence prolongs the effects of freezing,
considerably reducing the chances of survival of anyone who faces them.
"
Icewound Angel,"The body of this creature is at a temperature close to absolute zero even on the
hottest days of summer. A cunning commander of Andolin had one freeze the
surface of a lake on the eve of an important battle. After placing his army in
what seemed like an unfavorable position, the enemy fell into the trap and
divided their troops, half of whom crossed the lake. Then he had his Minotaur
Earthshaker shatter the ice with its powerful mace. They wore heavy armor, so
there were hardly any survivors.
"
Iconus,"Iconus is a magical creature created by the Auditors, whose sole purpose in life
is to carry out their plans. The inside of its body mainly consists of gears and
metal tubes, through which flows a liquid brimming with magic that must be
replaced every so often. Its skills in battle make it a precise and practically
infallible killing machine, capable of adapting to all kinds of situations as long as
it does not act alone. That is why, when the Auditors entrust it with a mission, it
is always accompanied by five other creatures, usually war-trained Carnages
and Fiends.
"
Igneous Ossein,"Osseins are relentless destroyers who at all times need to suppress their urges
to attack all the creatures around them. For this reason, they generally wander
alone through the Titan's Wound.

If it can, the Igneous Ossein spends most of its time under the blood of this
realm, stalking prey that goes near the shore. That is why its body is on fire, as
the temperature of this liquid is higher than lava's. This creature's fire is not
extinguished even after its death, which seems to be related to the strange
nature of the Titan.
"
Immortal King,"Up to now, nobody knows if Demigods can live forever. However, it seems like
they need to feed on the magic inside of items continuously. It may be
necessary to clarify that by ""items"" they also mean all other living creatures.

The Immortal King named itself thus when it learned the meaning of those
words, though it claims to have coined the terms itself. Trying to make it
change its mind is tantamount to suicide.
"
Imp Bishop,"Some Imps come to live in towns and cities inhabited by humans and other
intelligent species. There, a few find their way through the teachings of Surathli.
The most fanatical among them are the Imp Bishops, whose purpose is
spreading the word of Light. As expected, their people welcome them with
open arms, arms that hold sacks of rotten fruit to throw at high speeds towards
their faces.
"
Imp Hexer,"Imps are noisy, unruly creatures, more dangerous to themselves than to the
rest of the world. However, ambitious individuals abandon their villages to seek
their fortune outside their lands.

Imp Hexers have a natural talent for teaching magic to other creatures. Indeed,
they sometimes train Imp children from nearby families, who often end up
burning their own cabins when their parents are distracted.
"
Imp Incarnate,"The legend of the Imp Incarnate says that this creature will unite all the Imps
and lead them to glory. This is actually more a joke than a legend, or so some
believed. When an old ruler of Siralim declared war on the rest of Rodia, a
bright-eyed Imp appeared near some of the towns and cities that had been
invaded and could no longer defend themselves. Along with a horde of Imps,
this little joke has already plundered several human settlements and does not
seem to be stopping soon.
"
Imp Inscriber,"Imps love hallucinogenic fruits, although their diet also includes mushrooms of
any size, insects, and even dangerous creatures that they hunt in groups.

The Imp Inscriber does not really know what its tablets say. The symbols
simply appear mysteriously on their surface when it stores the magic of its
allies. Until the blue light is consumed, these stones act as generators that
constantly energize its peers.
"
Imp Necromancer,"Imp settlements are mainly found in the Faraway Enclave and the Cutthroat
Jungle. Large families of them lived piled up in small cabins, and their main
entertainment is inventing disputes with their closest neighbors.

In their culture, those who can make the dead walk are known as
Necromancers. The truth is that these creatures could not resurrect even a
withered tree. However, they have a wide knowledge about healing herbs that
allows them to heal most common diseases.
"
Imp Ritualist,"The Imps of the Cutthroat Jungle worship pagan gods that they themselves
invented. Torun hates these practices, but his strings of expletives cannot
prevent them from gathering at night to dance around their idols.

With a spasmodic dance, the Imp Ritualist moves among its companions,
waving its spear while making a tremendous effort not to spill the flammable
liquid that it carries in its other hand. This grotesque display surprisingly seems
to establish a mystical connection among its allies.
"
Imp Sacrificer,"Most Imps ignore that Torun is a God, a being whose power IS BEYOND
THEIR |@#$ING UNDERSTANDING. Some of them insult him and even throw
small stones at him. The God of Anger simply curses them, unless someone
dares to say the word ""tasty"". | WILL !@#$ING KILL YOU IF YOU SAY IT.

Imp Sacrificers perform a ritual in front of their idols, sacrificing an animal in
exchange for their favor. The faith of this creature somehow causes spells to
manifest spontaneously when it is in danger.
"
Imp Shaman,"Imps love crab helmets as much as any other otject that their next-door
neighbors hold in greater numbers than them. Luckily, their memory is quite
limited, so they quickly forget about it when they get angry.

Imp Shamans are the undisputed leaders of the larger Imp communities. They
know their people very well and act as spiritual guides and confidants, as they
are the most capable of resolving the usual conflicts that occur among these
creatures.
"
Impaler Banshee,"When the first God of Darkness was defeated, the shell of his body broke into a
million pieces. It seemed like everything was over, but then the fragments of
his body moved and came to life.

The scream of an Impaler Banshee is so strident that it can rupture eardrums if
it is heard from very close. Unlike the rest of its species, it only feeds on the
flesh of other animals, and has learned how to hunt and use tools by observing
humans.
"
Imperial Angel,"Every unit of Angels had an Imperial Angel at the head of their ranks. They are
masters of distraction, agile in flight, able to evade the blows of their enemies
until they reach their true target, the most important part of their strategy.
There, they drop a vial from their hands, creating a cloud of a mysterious
substance that stuns everything that comes in contact with it.
"
Imperial Voidlord,"Dragan tutored Ainsworth while she was a student, and he conducted
numerous investigations. Among other things, he studied the void through the
Voidlords. His findings led him to believe these creatures are the void itself,
poured into the universe through the cracks the Watchers used to slip into this
world. According to his hypothesis, the Watchers came from a dimension
without matter, and when they slipped through the cracks, they involuntarily
adapted to the laws of physics in our world.

Touching an Imperial Voidlord is even more dangerous than touching the
others, as even if someone manages to get away before being erased, their
mind is assaulted by delusions and feelings of impending doom that often lead
to suicide.
"
Inaer Rift Dancer,"Rift Dancers are part of the iconography of mausoleums and cemeteries in
many cities. The Inaer variety are more commonly seen during clear days.
Those lucky enough can find a large number of them in places far from
civilization, gathered in a dance in which they interlock their bodies, changing
partners with every turn. This dance is known as the Dance of Fire, and some
humans have tried to imitate it without much success.
"
Incandescent Vulpes,"When an old ruler of Siralim unleashed the power of ten Nether Orbs at once,
part of their magic was absorbed by this creature. It walks slowly, delicately
moving its two tails, but it has a relentless gaze. Its mere presence can
permanently unhinge the weak of spirit, turning them into pyromaniacs who
seek in the flames a light similar to its own.
"
Incendiary Smog,"This creature continuously expels fire, and can produce flames of up to fifteen
feet in length. If surrounded, it spins rapidly and blasts fire at full power to drive
its enemies away. It prefers to wander through dry places where vegetation is
scarce. Although this is fortunate for Rodia's forests and crops, Incendiary
Smogs attack merchant caravans even when they are at a disadvantage,
generally causing substantial losses before being subdued if not detected early.
"
Incursion Reaper,"Despite their unsettling appearance and the sharp scythe they carry with them,
Reapers are not aggressive unless they are attacked. They have eternal life
and are immune to all diseases. However, they are not immune to the effects
of magic.

If a creature's time has not yet come, the Incursion Reaper may decide to use
its scythe to return it fo a previous state where it was healthy.
"
Industrial Clockwork,"When an idea gains true strength among a multitude of individuals, it can take
shape—and, as it happened with Gods like Friden or Azural, a divine being
manifested herself due to the thousands of people whose lifestyles revolved
around steam technology.

When a Clockwork is not operating correctly due to wear or other reasons, the
Industrial Clockworks rush to repair whatever is needed. They are in constant
motion, receiving and transmitting all kinds of information to other Clockworks.
At present, due to the arrival of outsiders, they travel at all times with War
Clockworks.
"
Industrias Sanctus,"Spielrein and Baker executed the Sanctus prcject inside an abandoned
warehouse on the outskirts of Siralim. The seven Nether Orbs flashed and
sizzled, and the fourteen items rose in the air.

Sometimes, the Industrias Sanctus manages to sneak into cities and enters a
tavern. This always causes a stampede, because any loafers who are touched
by its hammer will work tirelessly until they die of the cold, exhaustion, or sleep
deprivation.
"
Infernal Guard,"Taylor always examined and questioned the criminals before they were sent to
the Torture Chamber. If they were skilled in combat, he offered them the option
of joining his guard. The ruler used a complex ritual to transform those who
accepted, inflicting severe brain damage to turn them into servants with no will
of their own; hefty warriors who had lost every vestige of what they once were.
"
Infernal Inquisitor,"Like Mikhail, Elinar was never able to use magic until he became a God. That
is why Tenebris helped both of them create their realms. Right before that,
Tenebris and Sevalah also instructed these Gods in the basics of magic.

Unlike Arachnalisks, Inquisitors are intelligent beings. Their language is made
up of clicks that are very difficult to imitate, but they can learn other languages
very easily. Infernal Inquisitors are the guardians of the underground passages
where these creatures live. They receive special training, body paint, and a
protective helmet.
"
Infested Slime,"Adter their uprising in the Refuge of the Magi, the Djinns noticed this creature in
the chamber where the Djinn Ghula had been created. They decided to destroy
it, but not only was their magic harmless to it, it also made it mutate with each
spell thrown at it. The Infested Slime was grateful for the spells and returned
the favor by also casting some at the Bjinns. It was not long before it grew
bored of the fleeing Bjinns and decided to leave the tower and see the world.
"
Infinite Eggling,"It all started with an ambitious Avion rider who did not respect the rules, and an
unscrupulous Mage who only cared about gold. The result was a creature that

never quite hatched from the egg. In fact, the eggshell itself is part of its body,

which functions as a carapace of sorts. This creature tries to imitate Avion, but
is rejected by them and only interacts with others of its kind.
"
Infinite Lord,"Despite their divine qualities Demigods need to sleep, which, according to
them, is because of the tedium of being surrounded by inferior creatures.

The Infinite Lord likes to boast of its power when a strong rival wishes to face it,
then let them think they have defeated it. When their expression of joy reaches
its climax, the Infinite Lord gets up, undamaged and pushes its opponent
against a wall to watch their smile become a grimace.
"
Inflatable Watcher,"Watchers have been undergoing changes for the last few centuries, as if their
structure were becoming unstable for an unknown reason. These are mastly
isolated cases, but examples like the Inflatable Watcher make it very obvious.
Scientists around the world are trying to solve this enigma, while a certain
secret organization has made the origin of this anomaly its main goal.
"
Inkjet Kraken,"The Revenants have always been busy fighting each other, but in the past
many of their peoples temporarily united to confront the Krakens.

Some Krakens feel curious about the surface, especially Inkjet Krakens, who
find the warmth of the sun on their head and tentacles pleasant and very
relaxing. When humans and other intelligent creatures took to the sea, armed
with weapons and magic, these creatures became endangered. Those who
could shoot the most ink were the ones with the highest chances of survival, so
nowadays, thanks to evolution, no one can find them after they release it.
"
Innocent Shambler,"Sea Shamblers are somehow able to reproduce, but they lose their instincts
and intelligence with each generation, with the exception of the Juggernaut,
who is not undead, and the Lugubrious, due to its special nature.

William James dropped anchors on the western coast of Radia, near the
kingdom of Ahruna. Much of his fleet had sunk into the Boreal Ocean, and
what remained was severely damaged. Still, there was room enough on their
ships for the large numbers of exotic creatures they took with them.

The Innocent Shambler, as the pirate crew named it, was one of the undead
creatures they found in the Boreal Ocean. They are meek, but skilled hunters,
and although they do not need to feed, they have not lost their instincts.
Occasionally, they capture prey and try to devour it, but pieces of chewed meat
inevitably trickle out of the holes in their body.
"
Inox Apocalypse,"As if having three heads was not enough, the God of Fire decided that the
Apocalypses would not be complete without at least being 10-foot long and
having a tail. They ended up being 15-foot long on average, having two tails
and a pair of claws as sharp as tempered steel. It seems impossible to catch
such a creature by surprise, with so many death threats flailing around, but the
truth is their necks are relatively vulnerable to attacks, a weakness that is
compounded by their having three.
"
Inquisitor Countess,"At the dawn of civilization, the world the Gods had created for the creatures
they gave life to was not yet ready for an extensive use of magic. In addition to
the rifts through which the Watchers crossed over, strange echoes of the
universe came into being, which would later be known as Itherian Realms.

Inquisitor Countesses are the wisest females of their kind, who rule over the
depths of the Blood Grove. However, they only receive this title at the last stage
of their life cycle.
"
Inquisitor Egglayer,"As time went by, the echoes multiplied and their connection to the real universe
increased, allowing some creatures to visit them. After several thousand years,
Dragan understood that the rifts the Amaranths had closed were slowly
reopening, causing the Itherian Realms to proliferate.

Not all Inquisitors can lay eggs, and those who can are called Egglayers. These
creatures only lay eggs once a year, and their gestation period is as long as
that of humans or satyrs, so protecting them from Eft attacks is the highest
priority for the other Inquisitors.
"
Inquisitor Weaver,"All Inquisitors can weave webs, but Inquisitor Weavers are adept at using their
craft to create three-dimensional traps. Their webs are also extremely resilient,
enough to even catch Efts. Entering an Inquisitor nest in the Blood Grove
before dinnertime is enough to prove this fact, as some of these terrible
creatures always fall into the Weavers’ traps.
"
Invidia Sin,"When a Sin appears, it does not usually remain in its place of origin for long.
Instead, it wanders through towns and villages looking for people to corrupt.

Sometimes, the Invidia Sin strategically leaves one of its golden mirrors on top
of a barrel or on the sill of a window. If an unwary person touches this item,
both they and their property become the oktject of desire of everyone they cross
paths with.
"
Ira Sin,"The Sin cult is relatively widespread in Radia. Its members perform strange
rituals that can summon these creatures by sacrificing others.

When the Kings met before the Unification War, an Ira Sin manifested in the
room in which they were assembled. Milner (who attended the meeting as the
King of Neralim's bodyguard) and Sigmund destroyed it in seconds. However,
that event marked the beginning of the Unification War.
"
Irantha Ophan,"Ophans were the last race to be created with the purpose of fighting the
Watcher threat, as well as the most qualified to do so.

The Irantha Ophan likes to stand on the shoulders of its largest allies, so that it
can cast spells from a safe position. When it moves its central ring, it channels
the energy of its Spell Gems to protect its party.
"
Iridris,"The cry of this creature, native to the kingdom of Ercath, is one of the most
terrifying sounds that exists. Luckily, it hates crowds and never goes near
towns and cities, not even small villages. Their genetic memory is very
particular, since they remember all the threats to the life of any ancestor they
had before being conceived. Of course, capturing one of these creatures is
extremely difficult, as they know many tricks, as well as how to hide and where
it is better to lay low. However, their peculiar scream provokes interest in some
wealthy individuals, so there are often mercenaries trying to hunt them down
without much success.
"
Iron Golem,"This war machine was created by the legendary Helmholtz at the time of
Rodia's Unification War. Devoid of feelings, the Iron Golem crushes its
enemies without mercy, leaving in their corpses the characteristic mark of its
sharp fists. Its true strength, however, lies in its versatility, though not all Magi
know how to capitalize on this advantage.
"
Iron Imler,"The physical development of Imlers is extraordinarily fast, and they can reach a
maximum height of 10 feet. Their powerful hands allow them to dig and break
through rock easily.

Iron Imlers are the fiercest of their kind, and they are usually in charge of
dealing with any matter that requires their 100-pound arms. This, of course,
includes the protection of their people, although there is always at least one
Imling with them to make sure they do not get overly violent.
"
Ironside Kraken,"Thousands of years ago, Krakens were the greatest danger in the deep,
relegating the Revenants to living in ocean caves and crevices to survive their
constant attacks. Over time, the Revenants' weapons and techniques allowed
them turn things around, so now Krakens only see them as emergency food,
not to be taken lightly.

The Ironside Kraken's shell is so hard that the Revenants stopped using metals
and minerals for their weapons and armor after they learned how to deal with
these creatures. Some of their buildings are also made out of these shells.
"
Jaculus,"Jaculuses are not native to Rodia. They belong to a harsh ecosystem found in
the mountains east of Yarthe, the northernmost country on the continent where
both nations are. They are small, but fast and fierce. In fact, they hardly ever
bite or claw at their prey, instead striking with their whole bodies at high speed
to kill them. Currently, some mercenaries and bounty hunters in Rodia keep
these creatures as companions, though a permit is required, and releasing
them is forbidden, as it could destabilize many of the country's ecosystems.
"
Jewel Cruncher,"Siralim's siege of Crux not only caused the Sentinel Watcher to escape, but the
Rod of Ruin was also split into two when the mayor of the city refused to reveal
its purpose to the ruler of Siralim. Unfortunately, that made the Temple of Lies
accessible through other means.

Because the Jewel Cruncher's shell emits a powerful, continuous, golden light
even after death, it has become the target of many warriors since these events
took place. However, Rodia's Council, or what remains of it, is considering the
introduction of a high tax on the sale of products made with this material, as it

would be unfair to the craftsmen who use magic to produce the same effect.
"
Jingle Elf,"Most Elves spend their lives among their own, but not all of them prefer life in
the forest. Some become mercenaries, bandits or just ordinary citizens in
human settlements. Jingle Elves, however, did not decide to abandon their
people but were exiled by them. The rest of the Elves consider these creatures
abominations, mistakes of nature. Any plants around them, even the largest
trees, wither and die as if the Jingle Elves were involuntarily absorbing their
energy, and their presence even seems to disrupt the rituals of the Elf Mystics.
Despite everything, Jingle Elves overcome adversity and prosper in society
outside the Cutthroat Jungle, often acting as minstrels for the great sovereigns
of the different kingdoms of the world.
"
Joker Luckmantria,"Luckmantrias flap their wings slowly, but they move much faster than one
might imagine, as the wind apparently wants to help them by flowing in their
favor at all times.

Unlike the rest of its kind, the Joker Luckmantria does not bother camouflaging
itself to hide the fact that luck is on its side. This creature flutters freely
wherever it pleases, letting itself be seen at all times, and even letting the
universe cause earthquakes if necessary to prevent being captured.
"
Jolly Old Giant,"It was a winter morning when the Watcher Sentinel finally bit the dust
thousands of years ago. The bloody war had ended, and that day became part
of the world's history, to be celebrated every year. The Gods had gathered in
the battlefield, and Vulcanar raised his finger to the sky and fired a spell to
create a colorful lightshow that thrilled the survivors. Torun, enraged, decided to
create a Giant that would travel to towns and cities delivering gifts on that day
‘without expecting anything in return”, because, although mortals were
insignificant creatures, he wouldn't let them favor his archrival over him.

"
Judge Familiar,"Familiars can communicate telepathically with other intelligent creatures, but
their topics of conversation are largely restricted to the scientific and
commercial fields.

Although it can stay at a comfortable distance in the air while casting spells, the
Judge Familiar does not do anything halfway, so it performs aerial attacks and
tries to slice off the heads of its enemies with its scythe.
"
Junkyard Bot,"Ubi Concordia is very different from other cities, as its technology is extremely
advanced.

There are hidden places where robot fights take place. Specifically, fights
between Junkyard Bots. They were initially at the service of the Auditors, robots
conceived for the construction and maintenance of Ubi Concordia, but due to
their simple Al, more and more are hacked each day for use in illegal fights, as
escorts, or as thugs.
"
Kaito Seraph,"Kaito was razed to the ground by the Watchers thousands of years before the
Seraphs existed. Gonfurian claimed the ruins of that kingdom, and they
became part of his realm. When the Unification War came to an end, many
Seraphs of the newly founded Rodia had lost their wings and ability to
reproduce due to the fall of the kingdoms they served, or rather, those they
were forced to serve. However, a group of these homeless Seraphs came to
Surathli and asked for mercy. The Goddess pondered for a moment and
decided to give them back their ability to spawn new Seraphs, uniting them all
into one single lineage. These Seraphs all took different paths, but they always
used their new blade to carry out the designs of the forces of good. Some of
them began to protect the ruins of Kaito from looters. Given the great cultural
value of those ruins, archeologists and historians began calling these creatures
""Keepers of Knowledge"", or even ""Kaito Seraphs"", as they are commonly
known today.
"
Kalasag,"Before Azural forged his current weapon, the mighty Wintermaul, he wielded
shields in each hand: one called Rhylthar and the other known as Kalasag,
otherwise known as the Brother Shields. Many years ago, Rhylthar was stolen
by a lieutenant of one of the first rulers of Siralim to use it as a catalyst for a
powerful spell. In response, Azural cast an enchantment on Kalasag, breathing
life into it and entrusting it with exacting vengeance on the king's man of old
and recover what was his. However, the lieutenant never went back home, and
Kalasag still seeks to fulfill its purpose to this day.
"
Kapre,"Kapre was a male Nix who managed to survive the genocide that took place
over nine hundred years ago on another continent. Although the Elves were
never kind to visitors, some sheltered refugees in their forests until the war
came to an end. Kapre was never a great warrior, but he was a good friend of
Elinar even after he became Morning Star. When he learned that Elinar was
going to leave this world forever, he accompanied him without thinking twice.
Apacranox, already a God, gave his friend the gift of eternal life, and from that
moment they lived together in the Blood Grove. Kapre has learned to fight over
the years, as he wanted to help the Satyrs and Inquisitors in their eternal war
against the Efts.
"
Kavnak,"Akimo Forest is riddled with curses due to a bloody battle that occurred there
during the Unification War. To contain the magic in that place, Milner and other
Magi performed a complex ritual that sealed all these curses within the trees.
At night, the shape of a face appears on the trunks, then emerges from the
bark to wander around, floating through the thick vegetation. They are not
aggressive creatures, and they do not need to feed, but they will respond with
full force to any attack.
"
Killer Cooler,"This creature can withstand extremely low temperatures and constantly
generates cold when it opens its jaws. Its breath is not cold enough to freeze a
person, but being around one can be unbearable without the right clothes and
even lead to hypothermia. However, as this is a Mimic subspecies, that person
would likely end up in its stomach (or whatever it has in its place) long before it
could die from the cold.
"
King Dumpling,"This is the largest Dumpling by far, an unusual specimen that cannot be found
easily. It lives in small palaces that have mysteriously been built in impossible
places, such as cold, rugged mountains without any flora or fauna, hidden from
view from almast every angle. These buildings are the birthplace of all
Dumplings, so they are riddled with these endearing creatures. Some are of the
opinion that this story is nothing more than a fairytale, while others desperately
search for the King Dumpling's home so they can capture all possible
Dumplings and earn a fortune. If threatened, King Dumpling becomes a
formidable foe that all Dumplings obey without question.
"
Kirin,"These dragons can emit a flashing light once a day through their horns that
blinds their enemies for several seconds. They often use this ability when they
are surrounded, which allows them to flee... most of the time. Some creatures,
such as Imps, have learned to close their eyes at the precise moment a Kirin
flashes, and have also perfected various strategies to capture them. Everyone,
even Imps, knows a Kirin's horn cannot flash when separated from its body.
However, owning one of these horns gives prestige to the Imp clan that has it.
Obviously, Kirins do not find this amusing, since even if they are never killed
and their horns grow back, they suffer during capture and extraction. For this
reason, they have started to destroy Imp houses at night, and shredding the
stolen horns with their hoofs as revenge and warning.
"
Kobold,"As with lizardmen, Kobolds are integrated into Rodian society and live in many
of its towns and all of its cities. However, unlike them, there are several
underground settlements exclusively inhabited by these creatures. Mining is
what the Kobolds who live in these places mostly do, but they are sadly often
attacked by creatures from the surface who want to seize the precious minerals
they extract. That is why all Kobolds living underground receive combat
training, even if they choose not to become miners.
"
Koloss Champion,"Kolosses are unique lifeforms, given their nature. The weapon they carry is, in
fact, the creature's real body, forged by Perdition during his early years as a
God.

Do not expect a conflict to reach a peaceful resolution when a Koloss
Champion is involved. According to an adventurer who recently explored
Sanctum Umbra, its anger can be measured based on the number of hands it
uses to strike. Be especially careful if you see the puppet holding the
Champion's body with bath hands.
"
Koloss Doombringer,"Kolosses can forge other intelligent weapons out of certain materials found in
Sanctum Umbra. However, this is a slow and complex pracess, so not all
Kolosses can give life to others.

The Koloss Doombringer is the only one of its species that really needs an eye
to see. This happens when an error is made during the forging or the
conception of a new Koloss, and a permanent full prcjection is forced on the
creature to prevent the flourishing consciousness from being destroyed.
"
Koloss Eradicator,"The steel blade of a Koloss is always sharp, regardless of how many times it
has seen battle. If a Koloss is blunt, it means the creature has died, either in
battle or after its five years of life have come to an end.

Koloss Eradicators are bloodthirsty warriors who show no mercy on the
battlefield. They take the destruction of their enemies so seriously that they are
unable to stop, even when the battle is lost. Interestingly, these creatures are
calm and kind when not in battle, preferring to resolve conflicts by talking things
out.
"
Koloss Firebrand,"When a Koloss's puppet is hit by a weapon or a spell, its true, steel body is also
damaged. However, the puppet is not affected by any damage to the blade,
unless, of course, it is completely destroyed.

The fire of the Koloss Firebrand's puppet is generally not deadly, but it is
essential when forging another Koloss. That is why Koloss Firebrands are
respected and even revered within their communities, especially during the
ceremony in which a new Koloss is finally brought to life.
"
Kraken Hundredhand,"Krakens were a danger to humans who sailed the high seas. But above all,
they have been a serious threat to the Revenants for centuries, as both species
inhabit the ocean depths.

No other Kraken sowed as much fear and destruction as the Hundredhand,
who can catch dozens of Revenants at once with its tentacles. Today,
Revenants catch these creatures and keep them in cages, feeding them and
cutting their tentacles daily as they continually regenerate, making them a
virtually limitless food source.
"
Kraken Shipbreaker,"The ocean is teeming with sea creatures that Krakens can feed on, which is
why a Rodian scientist theorized centuries ago that Krakens only attacked
Radian ships for fun. However, in reality, only Kraken Shipbreakers do this, and
not for fun, but because large ships scare away the prey on which they feed.
Today, ships are equipped with a state-of-the-art magical device that mitigates
the vibrations produced when sailing, so these Krakens are no longer a
problem on high sea routes.
"
Krampus,"As the lights are put out and children fall asleep, the night grows darker.
Tomorrow is a big day, there will be presents under the tree! But will everyone
get them? With a hoarse laugh and its hands resting against a foggy window, it
is ready to punish those who have misbehaved.
"
Lagergoyle,"When Siralim began its conquest of Rodia, its ruler transformed some people
into fearsome creatures to help conquer the country.

The Lagergoyle likes to perch on a tavern's counter and watch the customers.
If it believes they are not drunk enough after some time, it starts moving around
the tables and lets them drink from its body. These creatures are banned from
most cities for this reason.
"
Laglor,"Laglor was the result of one of the most ambitious prcjects that were carried
out in the Refuge of the Magi. Zonte's master, Ainsworth, participated in the
research when she was a mere apprentice. It all started with an immensely
powerful Nether Orb and the idea of creating a weapon that would allow
several Magi to channel huge amounts of magic to cast the same spell
together and even mix different ones. However, the calculations were
erroneous, as Ainsworth described in her doctoral dissertation on the creation
of magical objects using Nether Orbs as catalysts. Instead of creating the
perfect weapon, the staff came alive and did not take too well to the Magi
casting several spells on it. After disintegrating four members of the research
team, Laglor left the tower and began its mysterious pilgrimage around the
world.
"
Lappet Beacon,"The two Magi who created the Beacons were inexperienced, and though they
were successful, they lost their lives to exhaustion in the process of creating
them.

The Lappet Beacon is the only one of its kind able to pollinate flowers, though it
does so in fair measure so as not to alter the ecosystem in which it resides. Its
arms reach up to five feet, allowing it to immobilize or trip its enemies.
"
Laughing Wisp,"The Council of Rodia, concerned about the sudden appearance of these
creatures, is trying to find a way to keep them away from cities.

Wisps can move through inorganic matter, and they use this skill to remain
hidden and undetected. The Laughing Wisp particularly enjoys making use of
this ability, especially at night, in old mansions where few people live. There it
loves to laugh out loud, while moving from wall to wall or entering decorative
oktjects to terrorize the residents and occasionally provoke a heart attack.
"
Lavalotl,"Lavalotls are chatty, noisy pranksters wha live in the Great Pandemonium,
playing and laughing with their kind. Their games, however, often include
dangerous practices, such as pushing each other into the hot lava, resulting in
instant death for the pushed Lavalotl. Vulcanar enjoys conversing with these
creatures and often participates in their card games, betting large treasures
against them.
"
Leda Imling,"Imlings are as intelligent as humans, and their aptitude for magic far surpasses
that of the Imlers. Because of that, the bond that unites both races is especially
dangerous for their enemies.

Leda Imlings believe that taking care of the Imlers is their responsibility, and
never take advantage of them. When they see an Imler trying to leave the
village on its own, they run after it to join it in its journey or ask it to change its
mind if they feel it is too dangerous.
"
Leech Devourer,"These creatures are believed to have been created by the Gods in ancient
times, when they began to shape the world. They were probably considered a
failed experiment, and were therefore banished beyond the realms of the
Gods. The Leech Devourer is a clear example of this. It is technically able to
swallow any animal whole, although in a very awkward way. If it manages to do
it, however, its digestive system collapses and ends up killing the Leech.
"
Leech Digger,"The colossal creature whom Mortem named Titan was floating in an
interdimensional space near the edge of reality. To reach it, he was aided by
Perdition's older sister, a member of the Auditors with extensive knowledge of
magic and the structure of the universe.

The Leech Digger uses its powerful hands to hide underground, waiting for an
animal to pass over it. If it chooses the wrong place, instead of surfacing to
choose a better one, it just stands still until it starves to death.
"
Legion,"During battles, especially in conflicts between armies, innumerable injuries of
all kinds happen, and many of them involve severed limbs. One day, a Mage
came up with the idea of taking advantage of this fact to create creatures that
would join the ranks of the side for which he was fighting. The result was
Legion, a creature who obeys the orders of its master, capable of fighting
relentlessly for days. Although in the past these creatures could only be created
with recently severed flesh, magic has advanced enough to be able to use the
flesh of corpses a few days old.
"
Leper Blightbringer,"A Leper is less than a vestige of the person it once was. Its memories are
blurred dreams, and its thinking is slow and dull. Apparently, Taylor created
them by mistake while trying to figure out how to transform a person into a
Doomguard.

The Leper Blightbringer is a magnet for diseases, due to its weakened immune
system. It is extremely contagious to anyone around it, though prolonged
exposure to the creature produces defenses against its diseases.
"
Leper Defiler,"Although their reasoning is very limited, Lepers are killing machines that can be
extremely dangerous if underestimated. Despite their clumsy appearance, they
are incredibly fast, and their attacks are hard to predict.

The Leper Defiler's claws are extremely deadly to humans, as they can pierce
armor and transmit the disease. The victim needs to be vaccinated within the
first twenty-four hours, or they will transform into a Leper.
"
Leper Plaguespreader,"Centuries after the disease first appeared, a scientist from Caedo discovered
that it spread through the blood and wounds of Lepers, but one hundred years
would still have to pass before a vaccine was developed.

The Leper Plaguespreader gives off a nauseating odor that weakens anyone
not used to it. Moreover, it is a vector of a large number of diseases, so the
many kingdoms of Radia offer small bounties for both Plaguespreaders and
Blightbringers.
"
Lethal Smog,"The first council of Rodia approved a prcject to synthesize a substance that
kept away insects and weeds that were a threat to the crops. Naturally, magic
was involved in its development.

The smoke that the Lethal Smog emits is only as unpleasant as that of a
bonfire, and it is seemingly harmless toward living beings. However, any sick
person in its presence will automatically get worse, for in reality, this substance
weakens the immune system.
"
Lich Bloodletter,"The Lich Bloodletter can use the blood of its enemies to cast powerful spells. It
often kills the weakest enemies first, taking advantage of the fact that they are
usually sent to the front lines, then uses their blood to store powerful spells in
its scepter to decimate the strongest enemies. If it gets bored, it sometimes
hunts stray animals or people, cutting them until they bleed to death.
"
Lich Hellcaster,"When a large number of Liches gather, it is usually with a destructive purpose.
In such occasions, a Lich Hellcaster will put its fiery hand on the top of its staff
and then anoint the other Liches one by one. The process seems to stoke this
creature's flames. Like other Liches, it has a ghostly voice, and when the wind
blows strongly through the bony cavities of its skull, gloomy sounds can be
heard over the rustle of its tunic.
"
Lich King,"Sovereign of the great Lich hordes, it served the Lich Necromancer even in life.
It dislikes fighting because, after all, it wears a crown over its skull and has a
title of nobility. Although the title has been obsolete for centuries and never
meant much, it is still very important to the Lich King, who never stops
dreaming about the promises of power the Necromancer made to it.
"
Lich Necromancer,"Egas the Necromancer was a particularly important person during the
Unification War. He convinced the rulers of the small kingdoms in the West to
serve his purpose. He was a great Death Mage who, after conducting
numerous experiments, found the key to creating life from death. Before his
defeat at the hands of the legendary Mage Helmholtz, he used his own spell on
himself to remain in this world and kept working to achieve his goal of one day
ruling over Rodia.
"
Lich Netherwalker,"The blue flames of the Lich Netherwalker are cold and make no sound. Anyone
who comes into contact with them will see their willpower tested. If they are not
strong enough, they will become this creature's puppet for twenty-four hours.
Unfortunately, once its influence over its victim wanes, it can simply produce
more flames to control them again, repeating the process indefinitely and
turning the victim into a puppet for the rest of their days if it so wishes.
"
Lich Overseer,"Lich Overseers are able to move their scythe-shaped staff with great dexterity
and speed. When they see an ally trying to flee during a raid, there is no
warning — just a flash of silver followed by a head rolling on the ground to their
feet. The last thing the deserter will see is an Overseer's boot crushing their
skull.
"
Lich Priest,"It is said that the Lich Order is as old as Death Magic, although this is nothing
more than hearsay. Its hordes of Priests can block the roads and attack cities
alongside their superiors if nothing stops them. The touch of their hands can
heat up armor until it burns the wearer, and they regenerate from any blow that
does not destroy their skull, as if their bones were magnetized.
"
Lich Shadowcaster,"The Lich Shadowcaster walks alone mast of the time, leaning on its staff to
disguise itself as a battered old man. When someone tries to help it, it strikes
its would-be benefactor on the arm or in the face. The victim's body soon
begins to wither into an empty husk of dry, wrinkled skin attached to bones.
"
Life Shapeshifter,"From a young age, Shapeshifters practice on the animals and plants around
them to imitate their patterns. At the age of eight, these creatures are already
capable of transforming into beings twice or half their size.

Life Shapeshifters often take care of the sick and wounded, assist with
deliveries and guide the elderly in their last moments of life. They have a strong
sense of justice and protect the weak, even above their own lives.
"
Light Hunter,"It has recently been discovered that Hunters possess a complex language
comparable to that of humans and other creatures, spoken through
high-pitched vocalizations reminiscent of a cat's meow.

When a Faith Hunter gains enough favor with Meraxis, its body lights up and
the Ankh it uses as a weapon becomes a saber of light. Although it can still die
from wounds or disease, it gains eternal youth.
"
Lightning Cerberus,"When a Lightning Cerberus gets angry, the electricity that runs through its body
reaches 200 volts, so it can throw anyone who touches it into the air. This
creature does not need to bite; it channels its electrical energy into a sphere
capable of burning any creature it touches to a crisp. It is especially dangerous
on rainy days, because just touching the water on the ground where it is
standing can lead to electrocution.
"
Linta,"Linta was Hexilo's assistant long before he became Mortem. Hexilo and his
best friend River gave life to this creature and hid it from everyone. Otherwise,
it would have been destroyed, and they would have been expelled, as this type
of magic was forbidden without a permit, especially to students. For years, the
two friends believed they were hiding their secret well, until a promising new
student visited the facilities, shortly before they graduated. The little boy stared
at the spot in Hexilo's bedroom where he had hidden it with an invisibility spell.
That could have meant anything, especially in the bedroom of a Magi student,
but the little boy felt a strange presence and began to cast a spell of Dispel.
Luckily, before he could finish, Hexilo grabbed him by the arm and led him to
the common room to taste the blueberry pie his schoolmates had prepared.
There, the boy brought up the sutject of the bedroom again. ""Zonte! Be more
respectful of your elders!"" his mother exclaimed. Everyone laughed except that
boy. Two months later, Hexilo left the Refuge of Magi, taking Linta with him,
and it remained at his side even after he went into the Titan's Wound.
"
Lip Animation,"The lifespan of an Animation is very short, barely reaching three months,
unless its creator or current master gives it a Spell Gem for it to absorb.

The Lip Animation cannot avoid eating or drinking whatever is in front of it,
unless their master gives an order to the contrary every few minutes. Most of
the time, food and liquid just pass through it, but boiling water or fish bones can
cause serious damage to these creatures.
"
Lister,"Vertraag often jokes with the Goddess of Illusion that Lister is her masterpiece.
The God of Fortune can detect violence at any range. However, when these
types of events take place far away from his realm, they have to be very
serious for him to notice them at all. Unfortunately, when this happens, his
favorite activity is interrupted. There is no doubt that Yseros did an excellent
job, as Lister not only yearns for peace, but needs it to sleep peacefully.
"
Living Arbiter,"If an intelligent creature attracts the attention of the Auditors, but is not invited
to the organization, it is likely they will be injected with a mysterious substance
at some point in their life.

The tasks a Living Arbiter performs are somewhat different from those of other
individuals of its species. It is usually found in the field, where research of all
kinds is carried out, advising and resolving conflicts between researchers in its
own way. Of course, anyone who tries to steal or destroy a scientific prcject will
have to deal with this creature.
"
Lizard Wizard,"Lizardmen coexist with humans and other intelligent species in many villages
of Rodia and in all its cities. Their magical abilities, in general, are more than
questionable, but some manage to develop certain skills that are useful for
combat after arduous training that only a few are able to complete. Many of
them are in the service of Rodia's army, others simply use their powers to
make their daily tasks easier, and some decide to go on adventures. However,
there are also those who join criminal gangs, usually to extort and loot
regardless of who suffers for it.
"
Lost Amaranth,"When an Amaranth dies, it rises beyond the clouds and explodes into a
thousand pieces. Not even Sigmund, Helmholtz or the Gods know that
Emblems are actually the result of this explosion.

Unlike the rest of the Amaranths, the Lost Amaranth does not stop to observe
the world. Instead, it travels with groups of humans and other nomadic
creatures, protecting them with its very presence.
"
Lost Vulpes,"This creature does not tolerate its own kind, and it lashes its two tails
threateningly when it encounters them. It is believed that its coat has magical
properties, and some small-time merchants have begun to sell concoctions
that they claim contain its essence. However, if any of these traders had
actually gotten close enough to this variety of Vulpes, they would most likely
have been bitten before they could even think of running away.
"
Lugubrious Shambler,"This is the corpse of a majestic creature who flew in the skies near that island
where William James and his people found the curse that still haunts them
today. In its original form, the Lugubrious Shambler does not age, and lays a
single egg every one thousand years. It is a docile creature, but it becomes a
formidable adversary if attacked. James's crew lost over fifty of his men trying
to hunt one down due to a ""mistake"" of one of his boatswains. After making
him walk the plank as punishment, James took the undead corpse of this
creature with him to Rodia. During the journey, he discovered that its ability to
lay eggs not only had not disappeared, but had been substantially enhanced,
although its progeny was not exactly alive. The Lugubrious Shambler is not as
powerful as it was in life, which is a good thing, since it was able to cast
devastating spells with every tick of the clock.
"
Luna Beacon,"Beacons reside in a forest where an intelligent species, now extinct, used to
live thousands of years ago. The trees are covered in paintings of vivid colors,
and even today they have not been deciphered.

On the battlefield, the Luna Beacon's flight becomes an unpredictable
whirlwind full of feints and sharp turns. It always uses the lower part of its body
to strike, which is hard as iron.
"
Lunar Hemomancer,"Adter they ascended to godhood, Hexilo became Mortem and River became
Tenebris. Together they created the Bastion of the Void, the only place that
could contain the Voidlords' invasion of the world.

Despite their power over blood, Hemomancers are unable to use any of their
abilities on the Titan.

During a new moon, Lunar Hemomancers can calm the emotions of any
creature by touching an open wound on their body. Conversely, if this happens
during a full moon, the emotions are amplified, causing their victim to lose
control of themselves.
"
Lunatio,"Gangrel's city guard is mostly made up of mysterious creatures skilled in
dual-wielding swords. They communicate silently through gestures, but only
when absolutely necessary. If one of their own is in danger, any Lunatio within
a radius of three miles knows it automatically, and will come to its aid without a
moment's hesitation. During the Unification War, their presence was key to
detecting surprise enemy attacks before it was too late.
"
Lurid Masochist,"Although by law only the most dangerous criminals are sent to the Torture
Chamber, the roof has begun to collapse in some places, producing holes
through which innocent people sometimes fall or are pushed by gangs of
criminals.

If one does not emerge unscathed from a fight against the Lurid Masaochist,
serious measures must be taken for several nights. The poison of its katars
apparently causes the victims to harm themselves while they sleep.
"
Lurking Basilisk,"Due to their form, Basilisks move awkwardly and at a very low speed.
However, these creatures possess an enormous strength, as well as claws that
do not break easily despite their fragile appearance, which allows them to
easily pierce shields and metal armor.

The scream of the Lurking Basilisk was thought for a long time to inflict serious
injuries. The Magic University of Andolin discovered that their scream actually
stops time for fifteen seconds, which allows them to attack all their enemies.
"
Lurking Pit Worm,"When the Lurking Pit Worm chooses a victim, it does not stop until it is
devoured. Unlike the rest of its kind, this creature attacks even the most
populated cities. It may choose a traveler on the road, a woodcutter in the
forest, a fisherman in the river. It follows the vibrations of their steps to their
home. Then, in the darkness of the night, when all movements have stopped,
the Lurking Pit Worm slowly emerges from the ground in its prey's bedroom
and swallows them whole.
"
Luxuria Sin,"Sins are feared across the globe due to their extraordinary power. When they
manifest, they influence the minds and behavior of the weak-willed.

No one is surprised to see a Luxuria Sin near taverns and gambling houses at
night. In fact, the owners of such places often ignore their presence and let
them walk around with impunity, since, by dawn, many customers will have left
with their pockets empty.
"
Luxury Automaton,"The scientist who sold the Automaton blueprints has already been arrested by
the authorities, but the clandestine factories, some of which mass-produced
these creatures, were in operation for too long.

A rich businessman from Andolin decided he wanted an Automaton that looked
like him. When the kingdom's authorities came to question him, he was
accompanied by a Luxury Automaton who had a face similar to his, and the
same moustache. The tycoon denied knowing anything about the matter and
pointed at the Automaton, saying ""I don't really see the resemblance”, which
was not very convincing.
"
Macabre Masochist,"A century after the Unification War, a group of adventurers of renown decided
to try what no one had tried before: taking down Tartarith.

Masaochists do not need to eat or drink to obtain nutrients. Instead, they wrap
the tentacles that emerge from their eye sockets around magic items to extract
their energy. The presence of a Macabre Masochist can corrupt magic around
it, causing it to have the opposite effect.
"
Magma Construct,"The MK prcject was inevitably delayed by the overwhelming victories of
Siralim's army and its advance through the country. Its architects had to move
from kingdom to kingdom to continue the prcject until they finally ended up in
Nex.

The Magma Construct's body always has a very high temperature, so it can
quickly heat a whole room. This is why the Council of Radia is planning to set
up large buildings like temples or factories with several of these creatures, so
people can take refuge during the harshest winter nights.
"
Magma Golem,"Magma Golems are banned from many villages and towns for supposedly
starting fires wherever they go. While it is true that their body temperature is
extremely high, Magma Golems usually avoid getting close to anything
flammable, which leads to the conclusion that many arsonists pin the blame on
these creatures when they want to settle a score or collect insurance.
"
Magnificus Sanctus,"Something had gone wrong. Humilitas and Humanitas charged at their
creatures while the last Nether Orb, more powerful than the others, began to
react. An eighth Sanctus emerged from the vapors and approached Spielrein
from behind. Its scale tilted to one side. The wrong side. It plunged its knife into
Spielrein's back. Baker turned in time to pick her up and looked into her eyes,
terrified. A trembling hand stroked her cheek and a pair of lips smiled at her.
""Run"". And her arm fell, lifeless.
"
Malice Harpy,"The Malice Harpy is a master of camouflage and concealment, and the one
who most often manages to sneak into towns and cities. Its tricks never seem
to end, from playing with the night shadows to sneaking in undetected, or even
hiding under carriages or among the merchandise, or wearing a hooded robe to
walk through the main gates during the day taking advantage of the crowd. For
this and other reasons, guards often check the caravans who want to enter,
and look carefully at the face of anyone who tries to conceal their identity.
"
Malignant Spirit,"When Tartarith became a God after his son's torture, he returned the pain he
had caused him three times over. When Taylor exhaled his last breath, the
Malignant Spirit emerged from his mouth and escaped the Torture Chamber.
Since then, it restlessly travels the world in search of humans and other
creatures. Its very presence is terrifying, and it only gets worse once it
approaches. It can enter people's thoughts and bring out their fears and
worries, not letting them disappear from their minds.
"
Malignant Storm,"On a sunny spring day, Helmholtz and Milner were scouring the Unsullied
Meadows in search of a Nether Orb. At some point, the Hurricane and the
Storm Lord that were their respective companions began to compete,
discharging water and electricity in all directions. Their energy eventually
condensed, and the Nether Orb they were seeking started a reaction that fused
the two Storms into the Malignant. This Storm rains harder, contains more
electricity, and curses more frequently than any other.
"
Maluh Ophan,"Although the war seemed lost for the Watchers, nothing could stop the
Watcher Sentinel until the Maluh Ophan confronted it. Their battle devastated
an entire city, but in the end the Ophan was victorious. The Sentinel begged for
mercy with its eyes, but Maluh is a merciless creature, and it prepared a spell
to give it the coup de grace. It was then that the Vortex Observer sent its allies
to stand between the two, and it let the legendary Ophan know the truth.
"
Mana Vortex,"Aeolian gave Vortices great magical power, as well as the ability to change
their size at will to be as small as a mouse or as large as an average human.

The Mana Vortex is a being of pure magic that has the ability to block any kind
of spell, even from the most experienced spellcasters. During times of peace,
they gather near magic towers, forming beautiful rings of light around them.
"
Maniac Builder,"These creatures were exiled long ago due to their impulsive, bellicose, and
bloodthirsty character. Indeed, they are sa difficult to control that even
organized gangs prefer to do without their services.

The few Rodian scientists that have dared to study Maniacs have discovered
that the Maniac Builder's extra arms sprout during what seems to be their
adolescence. The reason behind this evolutionary quirk is a mystery, and at
present, their job within the tribe is limited to erecting palisades and the rough
mud huts in which their people live.
"
Maniac Chief,"These creatures do not seem to communicate verbally, but a young apprentice
Mage versed in multiple languages discovered during one of his adventures
that they communicate through laughter.

Maniac Chiefs wear the straps of the strongest Maniacs they kill. Almost all
tribes have multiple Leaders, who are usually the most experienced Maniacs.
However, they often disagree and end up killing each other.
"
Maniac Huntsman,"Maniacs are organized into small tribes of fifty individuals at most. Luckily for
the neighboring towns and settlements, they prefer to war among themselves.

The Maniac Huntsman's eyes allow it to sense heat better than the rest of its
kind. At night, it silently goes deep in the woods in search of diurnal animals
that never notice the danger which stalks them.
"
Maniac Mutant,"Maniacs do not sleep, and although they prefer to attack their own kind, food
shortages or boredom have at times made them a threat to society.

The Maniac Mutant is the only one of its species who has a tail and only one
eye. They usually have a calmer demeanor, but they are treated with contempt
by other Maniacs and incited to violence, so most end up developing the typical
restless, aggressive attitude of their kind.
"
Maniac Warrior,"These creatures simply cannot sit still for more than a minute. If there is food to
spare and no neighboring tribes lett, they gather around a fire, jumping and
laughing without rest, often pushing each other into the flames.

Although all Maniacs go to war, Maniac Warriors are the fiercest of their kind,
and often end up becoming Leaders. They are also the most restless of their

kind, and need to fight all the time. It is not strange for a Warrior to wound or

even kill a member of its own tribe just for fun.
"
Maniacal Ghoul,"Ghouls are undead creatures that have lost their minds. During the siege of
Omnia, the civilians and soldiers of the defending forces were attacked by their
own companions, friends and loved ones when they died in the bloody battle.

The bite of a Maniacal Ghoul is usually deadly, as once he clings to a victim he
never lets it go unless his head and limbs are destroyed first.
"
Manticore Conqueror,"The long tail of a Manticore is a dangerous weapon. However, the poison of its
stinger is only deadly to humans. No other Manticore handles its tail with such
ease as the Manticore Conqueror. Those who have fought one agree that its
tail moves as if it was alive, as if it could foresee its enemy's movements,
dodge blows and attack at just the right moment while the creature bites and
tears at another target.
"
Manticore Decimator,"The claws of the Manticores are as hard as the first metals humans used to
forge weapons. Nowadays, vervain is planted around towns and cities to keep
these creatures away.

The Manticore Decimator prefers to attack at night, when the darkness can
hide its presence. But what makes this creature especially dangerous is how it
deals with its enemies. When it fights, it completely foregoes defense, biting
and clawing at its enemies without caring about its own safety.
"
Marble Imler,"Every so often, a genetic mutation triggers a peculiar change in the egg of an
Iron Imler. Despite their tough-looking body, Marble Imlers are not as strong as
the rest of their species and break easily. Physical tasks are a challenge for
them, but they are still treated with respect by their kind and usually work as
mediators, acquiring great social skills and often becoming goad leaders for
their people.
"
Marine Pit Worm,"Marine Pit Worms are deep sea creatures who were brought to the mainland
by Revenant raiding parties. In their natural habitat, they feed on all kinds of
creatures, including, of course, the Revenants themselves. Their diet on the
surface is largely the same, and they act like voracious predators to anything
that is not a cat. For unknown reasons, the mere presence of these small
felines provokes an intense feeling of dread in Marine Pit Worms, driving them
to speed away as quickly as they can.
"
Martyaxwar,"Manticores have an insatiable appetite for human flesh. Even after a feast,
these creatures go in search of new prey to feed on.

The Martyaxwar is a unique creature. Its long fangs can pierce metal and crush
rock. It can also cast spells through its jaws that momentarily fracture space,
allowing it to bite its victim from a safe distance.
"
Masochist Angler,"Tartarith did not even introduce himself. When the seven adventurers stopped
at a crossroads, the God of Punishment came out of the shadows and stabbed
them before they had time to react. For their insolence, he decided to torture
them personally, destroy their humanity and turn them into Masochists. The
Angler was once the leader of the group, an agile warrior native of Ahruna who
wielded two katars. Tartarith liked the exotic weapons and replaced the arms of
the entire group with similar ones.
"
Masochist Freak,"This creature is not really a Masochist, but an automaton at the service of the
Auditors. If intruders were to sneak into the city of Ubi Concordia, the
Masochist Freak would run its attack program to end their lives. This creature's
plasma katars can pierce flesh and bone with ease, but their energy is limited.
When the energy is exhausted, it can put its arms into an organic body and
absorb its entrails until it is completely empty. Inside the Masochist Freak, a
chemical process will take place that transforms these organs into fuel.
"
Masochist Witch,"Seven adventurers went to the Torture Chamber to confront Tartarith. Three of
them were from Sithicus, strong warriors hardened by the extreme weather of
the Frostbite Caverns. Two came from Nex, where they had studied magic.
Ancther belonged to one of the few Swamplands tribes, and the last one was
the commander of Ahruna's sacred guard. Rumors say that the Witch was
once one of Erebyss's faithful who knew endless curses.
"
Master Shapeshifter,"Adter the defeat of Sigmund, Helmholtz took over the Genesis prcject and
completed it some decades later. Thanks to him, there are individuals who can
force two creatures of any species to breed, producing an egg with accelerated
development.

Master Shapeshifters have transcended mastery over the taxonomy of other
species and their own power. They can transform into any creature regardless
of size and emulate its prosody and gestures. They are undoubtedly the
ultimate spies.
"
Mauler Fiend,"A Fiend's diet includes any organic being, including trees if there is a shortage
of creatures. As long as they are adequately fed, they can become faithful
companions, but if not, their owner will become their meal.

Mauler Fiends are the easiest of their kind to tame, so many criminal gangs
use them as pets. There are illegal fights of these creatures in the suburbs of
some cities, in which bets can be placed.
"
Medusa,"Smiths and Gorgons share the same blood and need each other to procreate
in the wild. The snakes on their heads have a life of their own and attack
anyone who is not of the same species.

Medusa is a formidable warrior who combines the power of her paralyzing
gaze and her skill with the spear in battle, but she prefers to lurk in the
shadows, letting her snakes hiss and terrorize her enemies to make them flee.
"
Melon,"This variety of Dumpling has drastic effects on the central nervous system
when eaten raw. One bite is enough to double a human's heart rate and leave
them unable to sleep for three days, at which time the effects begin to subside.
Due to its effects, it is now being studied in Rodia for its medical applications.
On the other hand, if it is correctly cooked, the impact and duration of its effects
can be reduced to the point of being harmless.
"
Meraxis,"Meraxis's realm is an inhospitable place full of secrets that only the bravest
adventurers dare to enter. However, the God of Bliss is peaceful and
good-natured, and has a good relationship with the other Gods. Or, at least, as
good as it can be with the likes of Torun and Tartarith. His innocence and
carelessness have led him to remain on the sidelines during most of the
conflicts that have endangered the world. However, he decided to take sides
with the other Gods against the threat of an old ruler of Siralim.
"
Mercurial Slime,"Slimes are not born evil, but they like to playfully cast spells at each other. They
are not seen as a threat in most cities, and the authorities allow them to move
around the streets freely as long as their numbers are not alarming. If they are,
it usually means some kind of illegal magic activity is taking place, which puts
law enforcement into action.

The Mercurial Slime likes to play with stray animals, and sometimes steals
food from houses to feed them.
"
Mimic,"Scientists have tried to study the Mimic for thousands of years to learn its
secrets. This usually results in chewed tables and shelves, broken test tubes
and shredded books scattered throughout the room and, with any luck, a
mostly unharmed individual. What is more, no Mage has succeeded in
extracting this creature's core, although the legendary Helmholtz stated in his
memoirs that he would have been able to discover how to do it, had he had
enough time.
"
Mind Reaver,"Mind reavers are not very different from rhinos. Indeed, they used to be rhinos,
but a Nature Mage who sadly watched as they were hunted indiscriminately
decided to give them a weapon with which to defend themselves. These
creatures coexist with their non-magical siblings, constantly roaming their
territories for the sole purpose of protecting them. If a hunter manages to land a
hit on this creature, even if it is a deadly one, they will lose the will to hunt these
mammals for the rest of their life.
"
Minotaur Battlemaster,"Minotaur Battlemasters are in charge of training young Minotaurs in the art of
war. They are usually the oldest, whose fighting ability has been greatly
diminished by age, though younger Minotaurs with a gift for teaching can also
become Battlemasters. These creatures can wield almost any weapon and are
skilled battle strategists, which makes them perfectly suited for their job.
"
Minotaur Behemoth,"Most Minotaurs are native to the Kingdom of Heretics, and their settlements
are spread throughout Rodia, which has proved to be a headache for all of the
country's rulers due to their warlike nature, so they are watched closely.

The Behemoth is the commander of the great armies of Minotaurs and does
not falter when facing creatures larger than itself. Before entering battle, it
bangs its armor with its greataxe to signal to those who accompany it that the
battle may begin.
"
Minotaur Earthshaker,"Many Minotaurs like to hunt deadly beasts, as trophies are essential to being
considered a great fighter in their culture.

Although all Minotaurs boast great physical strength, only the very strongest
can become Earthshakers. Before entering battle, they pound the ground to
make it shake with an intensity that makes their enemies quake in their boots.
However, if someone manages to get close enough, they will drop their
powerful hammer to hit the enemy with their bare hands.
"
Minotaur Juggernaut,"This powerful warrior is always on the front lines and charges against its
enemies with ruthless might. Its progress is inexorable, its footsteps make the
ground rumble, and a blow of its mace spells doom for whoever receives it.
Minotaur Juggernauts are dangerous even for those outside their path, as they
can easily skewer anyone with their big horns just by moving their heads.
"
Minotaur Lancer,"As a calf, its Battlemaster told it that it would not get very far because of the
bad reputation of its lineage. Now, it has become a legend for being the only
Minotaur capable of defeating the powerful Subaqueous Dragon in single
combat. The tip of its spear is made out of one of the beast's fangs and used
both as a weapon and as a trophy to boast of its great feat. However, it does
not rest in its quest to find another worthy foe in Rodia.
"
Minotaur Skullcrusher,"Minotaurs only worship Gonfurian and war itself, and Skullcrushers are the
shamans who fan the flames of tradition with their words and rituals, which
range from dances that would be very picturesque outside a Minotaur tribe, to
sacrifices. Some warriors who face a Minotaur Skullcrusher may think its
weapon is fragile, as it looks like a human skeleton, but in fact it is made of a
heavy metal that can only be found in the Kingdom of Heretics, and
Skullcrushers can break common swords with it.
"
Minotaur Warrior,"Minotaurs are trained for war from the moment they are able to wield a
weapon. Some Minotaur Warriors, however, abandon their tribe and try to mug
adventurers who might have something of value. This is probably because,
despite their fierce appearance, they are actually the weakest of their kind.
"
Mirage Occultist,"In those times of magic advancement, some Magi managed to contact the
Gods. Or at least they thought they had initiated the contact themselves.

If the Mirage Occultist's staff is taken away from her, she falls to the ground
and remains immobile. After a few seconds, she dies. When he analyzed the
staff, Helmholtz discovered that, in addition to sharing some properties of
Nether Orbs, it has tissue inside that resembles that of human lungs.
"
Mist Crusader,"When several Mist Crusaders gather in a large group, a cloud of steam forms
around them that prevents anyone from seeing what is happening inside it.
This event has only taken place a few times in history; sometimes to protect
the creatures of the forest, other times to bring justice to gangs of marauders
that ravaged villages and small towns. Warrior tribes and criminals who
perform such activities keep watch at night in case the mysterious mist appears
in the distance.
"
Mite Gravedigger,"This creature often roams graveyards and hides in holes it digs itself or on the
roof of crypts until no noise is heard. Then it leaves its hiding place and looks
for recent tombs to feed on the flesh of the newly buried corpses. Like the rest
of its species, it has a nose for magic that sometimes makes it behave
aggressively when it encounters a Mage.
"
Mite Interloper,"Cautious and observant, the Mite Interloper waits for nightfall to act. It sneaks
into cities through the sewers, and from there it tries to enter large food
warehouses to eat the leftovers. If it is not hungry, it follows its nose to magic
item shops, since it likes to collect such devices, probably because of their
smell. Even so, it hardly ever succeeds, as the numerous thefts have forced
the inhabitants of Rodia to reinforce their businesses"" security and use traps.
"
Mite Invader,"When Regalis created the Mites, Vertraag burst out laughing and asked her if
her inspiration for them had been some sort of alien creature, or if her taste
was just that bad. Of course, Regalis just took that as a compliment.

Mite Invaders always travel in groups, leaving a trail of barren land wherever
they pass. They are considered a plague in every kingdom of Radia, and there
is always a small bounty for any mercenary group willing to exterminate them.
"
Mite Paralyzer,"Regalis created this creature to face the Creeping Arachnalisk and teach the
God of Time a lesson. She even had him witness the encounter. When
Vertraag saw how the creature that would fight his creation really looked like an
alien, he knew his words had not hurt Regalis in the least, but rather
encouraged her. The battle was over in a heartbeat, as the poison produced by
the Mite Paralyzer can stun even an elephant. Then, Regalis turned to Vertraag
and congratulated him sarcastically on his dirty trick.
"
Mite Plaguespreader,"This creature was once believed to be extinct, but it seems that killing off the
progeny of Regalis is extremely complicated. The Mite Plaguespreader is a
known transmitter of contagious diseases, and on one occasion it brought a
rare and deadly disease to Andolin that forced the authorities to put the
kingdom into quarantine for several months. Plaguespreaders whoa live in cities
hide in the sewers and come out at night to eat garbage.
"
Mite Skirmisher,"This creature lives mainly in rocky valleys and is an expert climber, as well as a
relentless predator. When it sees a goat trying to climb or descend the
mountain, it quickly moves towards it and headbutts it to make it fall. The color
of its exoskeleton allows it to blend in with its surroundings, but if it moves
carelessly, it can fall prey to large birds, so it remains motionless most of the
time.
"
Mite Webweaver,"This creature is responsible for one of the most unpleasant landscapes in the
country. Like Arachnalisks, Mites reach peaks of overpopulation once or twice
a century. When the forests of Radia are completely tangled in cobwebs, a
disgusting sight that causes serious damage to ecosystems, it means it is time
for the authorities to take measures. Its silk also allows it to survive in extreme
environments and to immobilize its enemies.
"
Mithril Imler,"Imlers and Imlings are intelligent creatures who have developed their own
languages. Although they can learn the human language, it is hard for them to
speak it due to their vocal tract.

Mithril Imlers have an extremely hard skin with magical properties that only
affect those of their kind. It also turns them into prey, as many in the upper
echelons of society desire their skin for its beautiful glow. Therefore, they
usually live in the depths of their villages, never exposing themselves.
"
Mitida Ophan,"The Ophans' appearance is not without purpose. Watchers hesitated to attack
creatures similar to them, which made them lose the initiative.

The Mitida Ophan can alter magical items with a mere thought, extracting the
spells inside of them without even touching them. It served a key role in the
Watcher War, enabling its allies to share their spells.
"
Mogwai,"A group of veteran explorers found a frozen creature one day while traveling
through the Frostbite Caverns in Sithicus. They took it with them and built a
camp. While they debated about its possible species around the bonfire, the
black of ice began to crack and the creature emerged. They did not understand
how it could have survived or how the ice had broken, but it seemed like a kind
and loving creature, so the explorers went to sleep without a worry. Upon
awakening, they realized the creature had stolen all their money, as well as
important tools and climbing gear. With great difficulty, they returned to the
capital and looked for information about what had happened to them. They had
been lucky. A student at the Magic University of Andolin explained that the
creature was believed to be extinct, in part because its extermination had been
ordered. This creature is kind and gentle while it is cold, and it can use ice to
enter a state of stasis indefinitely, but when it gets warm it becomes a deceitful,
malicious being who sometimes kills others for fun.
"
Monstrous Gargantuan,"Due to the violent tremors that occur during the mating season of the
Gargantuans, the villagers near their territory wrap their fragile okjects in
blankets as a precaution.

Some goblins make their towns in the back of Monstrous Gargantuans. They
even build defensive towers and walls. When this creature enters battle, the
goblins climb the battlements of their small fortress and drop heavy rocks on
their enemies.
"
Moon Crusader,"When this creature's mace hits the body of its enemies, the opaque sphere on
its head absorbs all light around it. For a moment, darkness falls and
uncertainty reigns. The Moon Crusader is a warrior of light who travels the
world in search of forgotten magic that continues to overflow and could cause
disasters. Using the power of its two spheres, it can absorb this energy and
contain the magic items that emit it... or simply destroy them with its incredible
strength.
"
Moon Hunter,"At night, Hunters light bonfires and dance around the flames for hours while
their wolf companions play on the dirt, biting and pouncing on each other. The
Moon Hunter, however, stands aside and meditates. The crescent-shaped
edge of its staff shines brightly during the dance, as it is recharged with the
positive energy that results from the Hunters strengthening their bonds. This
makes the weapon much deadlier in battle.
"
Moon Leech,"Of the five newest Gods, Mortem was the only one who did not create a realm
to stop the advance of the Itherian Realms. Instead, he created a powerful seal
inside the body of a creature the size of a star.

This dangerous creature flies high in search of prey, then drops on them.
Fortunately, its sense of smell is not entirely accurate, so it ends up hitting the
ground an alarming number of times. When this happens, the only thing left of
the creature is a slimy, lifeless mass.
"
Mortem,"Hexilo was a necromancer blinded by his search of knowledge. For more than
a decade he faced River, Siralim's most powerful Magi at the time. In reality,
they both studied together at the Refuge of the Magi, and were very good
friends, but Hexilo left the kingdom after graduating and unleashed chaos in a
nearby nation with his experiments. In the midst of one of their countless
battles, Dragan himself, one of the two founders of the Auditors, appeared in
person and stopped the fight, not without some difficulty. Hexilo accepted the
offer without hesitation, fascinated by the idea of the organization; while River,
who had serious doubts, only did it to keep tabs on his arch-enemy. For over
ten years, Hexilo worked for the Auditors under the codename Twilight. After
the incident in the Refuge of the Magi, the number of Voidlords increased
exponentially. Sevalah knew that even the power of Tenebris would be
insufficient to create a place capable of attracting the Voidlords to reduce their
influx, so she designed a plan in which Mortem would also participate. Thus,
the two ancient rivals created the Bastion of the Void.
"
Moss Golem,"Although a Moss Golem will never disobey an order from the Mage to whom it
belongs, it prefers to live in the depths of a forest, where it can stay completely
still and blend with its environment. If it hears the sound of woad yielding to the
steel of an axe, it will open its eyes and start moving with the sole purpose of
destroying the one who dared damage its home.
"
Mountain Priest,"Innumerable wars raged on the land the Gods had created for their children. In
an attempt to stop the endless spiral of destruction, Yseros created Lister from
forty-two Nether Orbs.

Priests are worshipped instead of Gods in many temples. For some reason,
the 300-pound Mountain Priest tried to help the tribes of Trolls and other
creatures that did not live in the plains. Although its work was not as productive
as that of the other Priests, it managed to considerably reduce their pillaging.
"
Mouth of Hell,"It appeared in Rodia shortly after a Mage first managed to meet and defeat the
Pandemonium King. She was somehow able to summon this creature after
that, and she invited her colleagues to join her for dinner, to experiment on it
and boast of her victory. It did not end well for anyone, as the Mouth of Hell
decided to explode into a thousand pieces while they were still eating.
"
Moving Arbiter,"On many occasions, Arbiters have no choice but to take action and confront all
kinds of thugs. Many consider these creatures altruistic vigilantes who ensure
the safety of every person in the world.

Some warriors who stood out for their physical strength end up becoming
Moving Arbiters. They are not known for resolving conflicts peacefully, but they
will not hesitate to intervene in a robbery or go after a thief.
"
Mud Golem,"The Mud Golem is the creature that inspired the legendary Mage Helmholtz to
create his artificial Golems. It is believed that it dates back to the creation of the
first Spell Gems. It hibernates during the cold season, but it is possible to see it
near abandoned temples when the weather is warmer, protecting ancient
magic that has long been lost to time.
"
Mummy Lord,"Over the centuries, the design of mummies changed and began to include
more colorful ornaments, among which were the strange orbs that the
explorers found in the wastelands.

When the Mummy Lord's orbs activate, they create a force field around it that
protects it from blows. Its appearance inspired respect in the people of Kaito,
and many prostrated themselves and begged for forgiveness.
Unceremoniously, this creature lifted its leg and crushed their skulls against the
ground.
"
Mumu,"Mumu is just one of the many infants that were cruelly murdered by an
overzealous Nightveil Spectre who sought to make a game out of knifeplay.
Now, Mumu wanders the lands as a compressed, corrupt version of what its
existence would have been had it not been killed, snatching children from their
homes and gobbling them up in a single bite.
"
Muse,"Muse is almost as old as art, although for thousands of years no one knew she
existed because she has never moved beyond her realm. Her realm is one of
the few that are popular tourist destinations. The reason is very simple—all
works of art that are conceived in the world and the different realms are
manifested in the Astral Gallery as living beings. Of course, this phenomenon
attracts a multitude of thugs who want to kidnap them to sell or kill them for fun.
The Godess of Creation vehemently condemns their actions and does not
hesitate to reward anyone who helps her deal with this problem.
"
Mutant Hemomancer,"The new realms also served as a way to seal dangerous creatures that
threatened the safety of the world, like the Voidlords, who could erase any
creature from existence.

With enough concentration, Hemomancers can draw a creature's blood
through a wound and move it through the air, or drive their own blood into an
organism. If a Mutant Hemomancer introduces enough of its blood into another
creature's circulatory system and it is not removed in time, an irreversible
transformation takes place that turns the creature into a mindless Hemomancer
who only obeys the orders of a Hemomancer Lord.
"
Mutated Crypt Bat,"Mutated Crypt Bats have developed intelligence due to prolonged exposure to
magic. They are also known as ""windfangs"" in many places because of their
ability to fly at extraordinary speeds, and they are capable of tearing off large
chunks of flesh from their prey before it even notices anything is wrong.
"
Mutated Pulse Bat,"These creatures are the reason why many villages and towns have Familiars
watching over the streets, signs with drawings of Familiars, or even scarecrows
in the shape of them, as Mutated Pulse Bats are quite scared of that species.
They are self-aware, and they find it easier to raid human larders than to waste
time hunting for wild animals.
"
Mutated Vampire Bat,"Just like standard Vampire Bats, they seem to be attracted to coins, though in
their case it is for a good reason. These intelligent creatures are literate, and
they often visit the marketplaces of towns and villages to buy food and books.
They usually live in abandoned houses near urban areas and earn their living
as messengers, although many of them prefer to simply attack travelers and
steal their money.
"
Mystery Mucus,"A single tablespoon of the substance Concoctions are made of is enough to
fatally poison more than 10 individuals.

The Mystery Mucus carries a barrel, but nobody knows what could be inside. It
is literally a mystery! Some less-than-bright smugglers have tried to use them
to transport illegal goods, but unfortunately for them, the trail they leave behind
is strong evidence of their activities.
"
Mystic Warhog,"Warhogs are meek creatures who avoid humans, orcs, and other intelligent
beings at all costs.

The Mystic Warhog's supernatural powers are well known to the inhabitants of
Rodia, and it is said a Nature Mage granted these powers to them in ancient
times. When one of these Warhogs senses the presence of a being who
wishes it harm, it rears up and screams wildly.
"
Mystical Familiar,"Created to assist Magi in their tasks, it wasn't long before they realized they
had no real reason to devote their lives to serving their masters, and they
rebelled, taking advantage of chaos during the Unification War. This is why
they have little love for Magi.

The Mystical Familiar has an innate preference for quiet forests and creates its
home inside thick tree trunks.
"
Mystical Giant,"Adter creating the Apocalypses, Vulcanar appeared before Torun and showed
him one, stating that no Giant could destroy as many Watchers as his ""little
girl"". That infuriated the God of Anger, who was already furious to begin with,
so he challenged Vulcanar to a duel between his final Giant and whatever
""PIECE OF !@#$"" the Elemental King wanted. This is how the Mystical Giant
was born, a 35-foot Giant with skin as hard as steel and the strength of a
seventeen-ton killing machine.
"
Mythicant Calti,"Accidents in magic towers during the numerous experiments that have taken
place throughout history were not exactly rare. And although nowadays they do
not occur so often in magic universities, the origin of the Mythicants is one of
these exceptions.

The Mythicant Calti spends most of the day sleeping, though it also likes to
chase mice or play with other cats. It often uses the three orbs that orbit around
it to play with its friends.
"
Mythicant Erdhe,"In order to create books that could convey their content through an artifical
voice, an experiment was recently carried out that imbued a series of novels
with a huge magical charge.

The Mythicant Erdhe's luminescent symbols are clearly visible at night. When it
enters combat, they glow so brightly that staring at them is unpleasant.
"
Mythicant Palmira,"Mythicants were born in Andolin due to an unfortunate ritual, as well as the
magic contained in several novels based on the struggles of an Andolian
soldier during the Unification War.

The sword of the Mythicant Palmira turns to ash as soon as it stops holding the
handle. When this happens, it can create a new one by simply touching
another pile of ash.
"
Mythicant Populi,"The Mythicants took shapes related to the three novels based on the diaries an
Andolian soldier wrote during the Unification War. Anyone in possession of one
of its pages can control a Mythicant.

The Mythicant Populi uses its book and blade to protect itself from enemy
attacks. Unlike other Mythicants, it materializes words outside of battle that
float above its head and describe what it is doing at all times.
"
Mythicant Pryderis,"Mythicants are not aggressive unless they are in danger or unless they have
been given orders. They are able to materialize words with negative
connotations and use them to harm their enemies.

In the case of Mythicant Pryderis, it is their arrows that become words once
they are fired from the bow. There are only six arrows in their quivers, but as
soon as one of them hits, it disappears and re-materializes behind it in its
original form.
"
Mythicant Solis,"Mythicants do not do much besides training, sleeping, or chasing mice, though
they always defend the victim when they witness an assault.

The mace of the Mythicant Solis does not always have the same shape. When
it attacks an enemy and hits them with its weapon, the round part of it
transforms into words that cause damage. As soon as this creature pulls back
the hilt, the mace instantly returns to its former appearance.
"
Nadin Rift Dancer,"There are no written records of Rift Dancers until the time of the first wars in
which magic played an important role.

Nadin Rift Dancers detest the darkness, so they gather near the lights of city
walls or village squares during the night. As they do not pose a threat to most
people, even children are allowed to play with them, and they are considered to
be a fascinating sight. Some people even allow them into their homes and let
them spend the night by candlelight.
"
Nalas,"Fae always travel in groups, except if they are with a Brave. Their coordination
is perfect and they can separate to make surprise attacks using bait, or attack
from two different flanks to confuse their enemies, not letting them react to the
attack properly. Nalas, Shallan's right hand, is in charge of settling conflicts
among the Fae when they cannot solve them on their own.
"
Narklin Ophan,"Although the Ophans' ability to communicate is very limited, they are
self-aware and have prodigious intelligence.

Narklin Ophans cannot stand to watch others suffer, so they used to be a

common sight near hospitals, where they lent their help for free to heal wounds
and cure diseases. However, humans began to hunt them to take advantage of
their powers and even make a profit, which ended up creating distrust in them.
"
Nature Shapeshifter,"Not all Shapeshifters develop their potential. Some dedicate themselves to
routine tasks, and only develop their power enough to protect themselves from
the inclemencies of the weather.

From a very young age, Nature Shapeshifters prefer to transform into trees and
plants to feel in harmony with nature. When they reach a certain skill with their
powers, they fly over the forests, meadows and swamps of Radia in the form of
a bird or an insect.
"
Nax Rift Dancer,"Crowds of these creatures can be seen in the spring and summer, when the
forests are lush. At the top of the trees, Nax Rift Dancers perform a frantic
dance that seems to unleash a storm of leaves. Nearby animals often observe
their movements carefully, without showing any fear beyond the initial surprise,
probably due to the sudden noise.
"
Necro Grimoire,"Grimoires can be used by humans and other creatures who can use magic to
cast the spells they contain.

There was once a Mage in the Columbia Tower who secretly compiled a series
of dangerous curses in one of the Grimoires. That must have attracted the
attention of Apollinaire and awoken it from its slumber, as it ripped half of the
Necro Grimoire's pages before leaving the tower.
"
Necropolis,"In his journey to conquer Rodia, Egas the Necromancer created this creature to
instill fear in his enemies and poison them. He had some problems at first, as
the Necropolis insisted that the Necromancer stay within it, but he later realized
that its behavior could be quite useful and decided to use it to his advantage by
setting several of them free in the lands of his enemies.
"
Necrotic Clutcher,"Taylor seemed to have no emotions, and his tastes were getting worse with
age. His parents, who feared him, decided not to scold him, instead
abandoning him when he was a teenager and fleeing the city.

The Necratic Clutcher tears the garments of its victims with its fingernails, then
grabs their bare wrists or ankles. The tissue that comes in contact with this
creature progressively withers until it becomes a piece of dead flesh.
"
Nephilim Cleric,"When Arcadia became the Path of the Damned, the Angels who had survived
the epic battle transformed into the Nephilim.

Of all the Nephilim, the Cleric is probably the mast dangerous. A low murmur
heralds its presence, similar to that of the wind caressing the ruins of a
desolate city. Anyone who listens to it long enough will become an agent of evil
until this creature is destroyed. The more light there is in that person's heart,
the longer it will take to be converted, and the crueler their acts will be.
"
Nephilim Lord,"Erebyss hid the Nephilim in the deepest recesses of the Path of the Damned
for thousands of years, to prevent them from unleashing chaos among mortals.
All Nephilim are dangerous, but the Lord seems to go even further. It does not
usually target ordinary people, not even those who devote their lives to helping
others. The Nephilim Lord prefers its victims to be powerful, influential people.
A single wound from its sword will turn them into complete lunatics who will, for
example, subtly unleash a plan to plunge their own nations into misery.
"
Nephilim Scion,"Nephilim are drawn to good intentions and pure hearts. They seek to subdue
them and turn them to ashes. The Nephilim Scion's powers allow it to confuse
the thoughts of anyone within reach, sowing doubt about the intentions of
others towards them. Recently, one of these creatures appeared in the village
of Hutika and quietly passed through as its inhabitants went about their work.
That night, the village had turned into smoking rubble, and every Uralos in it
had become a soot-covered corpse.
"
Nephilim Shieldbearer,"All sentient creatures find the Nephilim's very presence disturbing. Even a
sadistic, unscrupulous ruler or the cruelest of criminals are terrified when one of
these creatures approaches.

When a Nephilim Shieldbreaker chooses a target, it does not attack directly,
instead seeking out those who matter most to its victim and turning them
against each other with a single touch of its shield. In this way, its victim will
have to witness in horror as their loved ones try to hurt each other in every
possible way.
"
Nephilim Skirmisher,"It is believed that the Nephilim were released from their prison after recent
events in Rodia, but their numbers were not a cause for concern for the
governments of the different kingdoms, until now.

Unlike other Nephilim, the Skirmisher acts ruthlessly. This creature is a
bloodthirsty assassin who searches for purehearted people for the sole purpose
of bathing its weapon in blood. It prioritizes those with the purest convictions,
but it also attacks even the worst scum, as even they have done good at some
point in their lives.
"
Nephilim Sorcerer,"The Nephilim are feared everywhere in the world, and getting rid of them has
become a top priority in many places.

The Nephilim Sorcerer can absorb the feelings of those who want to care for
others, turning its victim into an apathetic, motionless puppet. However, this
creature always returns what it took, after twisting those motivations to turn its
victim against the person they wanted to help.
"
Neralim Seraph,"However, conflicts among the different human kingdoms scon arose. Surathli,
full of sadness, watched as the new world filled with decadence, but she did not
lose hope.

The Neralim Seraph is quiet and wise. It likes to spend time in silent, dark
rooms by candlelight, in the company of books. It is able to channel the wrath
of its enemies into its own blade and use it as a catalyst to cast a barrage of
spells.
"
Nex Seraph,"And the kingdoms that opposed peace fell into oblivion, their kings condemned
to relive their mistakes for eternity in the Kingdom of Heretics, their cities
wastelands and ruins, their Seraphs, extinct.

Nex Seraph is the most powerful of its species, and, at present, it represents
the last hope for Rodia. It was the first of them all and stayed with Surathli in
the Azure Dream until its presence was required in the country. Its mission is to
avoid a new slaughter, but perhaps it is too late.
"
Nexus Amaranth,"No other creature is as mysterious as the Amaranth. At first, they wandered the
world. They were peaceful observers that floated from place to place, moved
by curiosity. As time went by, they approached other creatures and shared their
secrets.

During the Unification War, a large number of Nexus Amaranths moved from
all over the world to watch the bloody battles. Sigmund took advantage of the
peculiarity of these creatures to warn King Misery that he was going to be
besieged.
"
Nguruvilu,"Lake Kalazan makes up a large part of the kingdom of Andolin. There begins
the life cycle of the creatures called Nguruvilu. When they reach maturity, most
of them descend the Sevinor River and travel to other regions. They hide under
the water, motionless, waiting for prey to pass over them — unless they detect
magic. The presence of a Mage or a magical beast pushes them to the
surface, as their scent is irresistible to them.
"
Night Koloss,"In the middle of battle, Kolosses can add extra tissue to their puppets to make
them harder to take down. It is currently believed that this ability could have
medical uses.

Night Kolosses, named so by a human adventurer, are good leaders, but they
stand out most of all for their ability to understand the emotions of their peers.
Most of them use this advantage to improve their quality of life, but some
others, more ambitious and devious, prefer to manipulate them in order to gain
power.
"
Nightmare Golem,"With its incredible amount of magical power, the Nightmare Golem can put its
opponents to sleep with ease. A Mage named Magendie once used this
creature's power to combat his insomnia, and he even offered the service to his
fellow citizens.
"
Nightmare Mummy,"The only ones who had the privilege of being mummified were usually the
sovereigns of Kaito, once they exhaled their last breath. However, there was a
punishment reserved for a few in a which a traitor was condemned to be
mummified in life, along with many other hardships.

The Nightmare Mummies dealt with the priests and priestesses of Kaito. When
their spells hit the dark bandages, a strange purple halo appeared that
absorbed the magic, leaving them powerless to face the creatures.
"
Nightveil Construct,"The Constructs helped the army of Nex to protect civilians in the streets of the
capital and to guard its walls. When the war was about to end, they became
available for general purchase in the kingdom.

The Nightveil Construct is equipped with a speech synthesizer that activates in
certain conditions. Moreover, it can store voice messages in its memory, which
makes it a particularly useful nighttime messenger, due also to its ability to go
unnoticed in the dark.
"
Nightveil Spectre,"Sigmund spent mast of his life in Eternity's End, observing and studying the
flow of time. Faced with the coming chaos, Vertraag helped him to protect
Radia, or so the God of Time made him believe.

When newborns are orphaned, their primal sadness makes this creature
appear. It takes care of the baby, but never lets them age, instead channeling
that temporal energy to wear down its enemies’ health.
"
Nightvelvet Gemling,"It was Dragan, a Raven from the Refuge of the Magi, who had the idea of
activating an ancient and hidden magic item in his hometown: The Rod of Ruin.
Its name, he said, was a reminder of the price his people paid due to the the
atrocities committed by humans.

Nightvelvet Gemlings cannot remain still. In fact, if their movements are
contained, they quickly turn bright red and explode into a thousand pieces,
unless they are released in a few seconds.
"
Nightwing Gargoyle,"The forces of Undolim ambushed the invaders from the rooftops of the
Cathedral square, using arrows and spells. When the enemy fled in disarray to
regroup, the Gargoyles descended like rain with their claws and fangs of stone.

The Nightwing Gargoyle uses the influence of the moon to absorb the magic of
its surroundings. During a new moon phase, this creature perches on the ledge
of a colorful building and remains motionless, waiting for it to end.
"
Nihilist Ender,"Nihilists appeared all over the world very recently. Most of them roam in small
groups, though they sometimes gather in large numbers.

While any Nihilist can take down a Voidlord, none do it as well as the Nihilist
Ender. In addition to sensing the presence of any Voidlords within a mile of it,
its weapon deals incredible damage to these creatures, disintegrating them the
moment they pierce their bodies.
"
Nihilist Paralyzer,"Nihilists will never attack unless they are in danger, unless their opponent is a
Voidlord. They do not communicate in any way with other creatures, and they
do not need to breathe, feed, or sleep to survive.

The ribbons on this creature's staff are harmless to all except Voidlords. When
they come into contact with these beings, they automatically coil around their
bodies, paralyzing their movements and nullifying their abilities.
"
Nihilist Protector,"The existence of the Nihilists is believed to be linked to that of the Voidlords. In
fact, there are those who think these creatures exist only to end them.

When a Nihilist Protector places its hand on its book and chants, all creatures
within a mile of it are shielded from the Voidlords' powers for thirty-six days.
"
Nihilist Sealer,"The Voidlords' ability to wipe any creature out of existence does not work at all
on the Nihilists.

The mere presence of a Nihilist Sealer nullifies the Voidlords' power to make
any creature vanish within a mile of this creature.
"
Nihilist Seeker,"The moment the Nihilists materialized in this universe, someone smiled in true
satisfaction at the End of Eternity.

When the Nihilist Seeker performs a dance with its staff, it can locate where
any creature has vanished due to the powers of a Voidlord within a mile of it,
regardless of when it occurred.
"
Nihilist Summoner,"Only a few are aware that the Nihilists are the materialization of the very will of
the universe fighting to survive. Many intelligent creatures find their appearance
disturbing, yet animals are completely unaware of their presence.

The Nihilist Summoner's power is probably the most extraordinary. When a
Nihilist Seeker points out where someone has disappeared at the hands of a
Voidlord, this creature places its hand on its book and begins to chant. Ina
matter of minutes, every creature within a mile that had been erased from
existence will reappear as if nothing had happened.
"
Nine Tailed Harvester,"Nine Tailed Harvesters inhabit the Hamubo Rocky Mountains, to the southeast
of Yarthe. Since the dawn of their civilization they have worshipped death, and
to them Harvesters are sacred creatures who should not be disturbed under
any circumstances. Their lives revolve around their customs and rites, centered
on meditation, and they do not seek war with other peoples. However, they also
need to defend themselves. All Nine Tailed Harvesters receive combat training
from a young age, and all of them use a scythe in battle.
"
Nisha Cherub,"Of the other creatures of Rodia, reactions to Cherubs tend to vary. Of particular
note, Spectres seem to be utterly terrified of Cherubs and will flee at the mere
sight of one, panicking and lashing out if cornered. Demigods on the other hand
are zealously protective of them, for reasons they refuse to elaborate upon.
The reasoning seems to be religious in nature, but none can say for sure.

Nisha Cherubs seem to be one with the void — they perpetually exist within a
dark vaccuum that surrounds them, in which no form of matter of energy at all
can be found. Those who gaze into this void report impossible and bewildering
sights they often can find no way to explain or put into words, but the more
magically attuned simply see true nothingness as if it were a hole in reality.
"
Nix Backstabber,"There was once a Nix who envied mankind. Their civilization prospered, while
Nixes still lived in small settlements that did not. This rage led her to Gonfurian,
and she asked him to eliminate the humans. The God of War laughed out loud,
but he offered her a solution in exchange for passing a trial. The Nix accepted
and had her own village fight a human town. They lost. Then, Gonfurian
appeared before her and gave his favor to a mortal for the first time in history...
plus another ""small"" gift.
"
Nix Creeper,"The Nixes are an intelligent species that lives in underground cities. At present,
they are not at war with any other.

Some Nixes are known to leave no trace after a murder. In the surface lands
they are called Nix Creepers. They can sneak into well-protected mansions,
bypassing any security in the gardens and corridors without being discovered.
The next morning, everything will remain intact except for their target, which will
have become a corpse.
"
Nix Exile,"Some Nixes are banished from their towns and cities for serious crimes. Many
look for underground caves to settle alone or with others of their kind who have
also been exiled. Others seek their fortune by working for the less important or
newer crime syndicates. Their methods are usually less orthodox than those of
the other Nixes, and their goals are much more varied. When they carry out a
mission, their success rate is clearly lower and they often make a mess.
"
Nix Guardian,"In Nix societies, females occupy higher places in the hierarchy. They hold the
moral authority and leadership, and always govern through a council of eight
women.

The Nix Guardian usually works as a personal bodyguard for great merchants
or crime bosses, and also does the dirty work when it is necessary. When two
Nixes meet because of this, they fight to the death on an equal focting, with
their faces uncovered.
"
Nix Imposter,"In the past, Nixes had a certain animosity toward the humans, and a great
antagonism toward the Elves. After several centuries of war, they signed a
peace treaty when Lister sent his Priests around the world.

Out of all the surface Nixes, only Impasters still work for their people. Their
okjective is to find any men of their species who have escaped the
underground cities to bring them back and have them suffer their deserved
punishment: an unspeakable torture that lasts for a week.
"
Nix Informer,"Only female Nixes are allowed to visit the surface and be in contact with other
intelligent species. Indeed, any male Nixes who wish to trade with the humans
and dwarves who visit their cities must be accompanied by a woman at all
times.

Although Nix Informers usually work for large corporations, they sometimes act
as government spies who, if necessary, eliminate key figures that could
jeopardize their interests.
"
Nix Scoundrel,"Some Nixes are integrated into human society. Many work as hired killers due
to their renowned agility, stealth, and skill with knives.

When someone hires the services of a Nix Scoundrel, it is very clear that the
target is going to suffer before dying. These creatures are bloodthirsty
murderers who are experts in torture, and experts in leaving gruesome crime
scenes. They usually also murder the target's family in front of their eyes.
"
Nix Shadowjumper,"Nixes who work as hired killers wear a mask to prevent anyone from
recognizing them, but also to indicate their specialty. In their daily life, surface
Nixes are treated with a certain forced respect for fear of their abilities.

Nix Shadowjumpers are especially dangerous, and their services are the most
expensive ones to hire. Through their knowledge of magic, they can use the
Path of the Damned to appear behind their target, as long as they have one of
their personal items.
"
Nox Sinon,"In the forests of Yarthe lives an intelligent species, fully integrated into its
ecosystem. Even as children, they interact with all the creatures who live there,
establishing bonds through play, and caring for them when needed. When they
reach adulthood, they are able to summon them wherever they go, and they
will fight with them regardless of the danger involved in doing so.
"
Noxious Smog,"Centuries ago, a team of chemists and Magi hastily developed dangerous
technology. The result was an unstable machine and the biggest explosion in
history.

Being close to the Noxious Smag is too dangerous for any creature, due to the
toxic vapor that surrounds it. In addition, finding a natural antidote for its venom
is too difficult, as its composition is different for each specimen.
"
Noxpit,"This creature was the first one Venedon gave life to in the Caustic Reactor. As
soon as he saw it, the God of Deceit shrugged and thought ""Well, | did my
Although its appearance was not what he expected, it performs its
function perfectly, devouring nuclear waste to completely eliminate it without
suffering any damage in the process. Currently, several of these creatures tour
the Caustic Reactor with the sole purpose of removing the nuclear radiation this
realm produces.

"
Nugget,"This creature has often been attributed miraculous properties, for many
reasons. Around this creature, trees bloom, crops manage to grow despite the
droughts, and grass sprouts where it should not. Finding one is an
extraordinary feat, and keeping one close is extremely difficult, as it can easily
escape by becoming imperceptible to the senses of living beings.
"
Obscene Blight,"Hundreds of miles north of Rodia there is a small underground kingdom, ruled
by creatures who can see in the dark, and who dig tunnels with their strong,
sharp claws. Although from the beginning of time they were known in what
would later become Rodia as the Skyless, they are now called Obscene Blight
because of an event that took place when the Asura tried to conquer their
kingdom hundreds of years ago. They simply dug tunnels in such a way that
the earth would collapse as the enemy army walked on it, rushing them to their
deaths. Most of these creatures are peaceful and do business with other
kingdoms, and there are still those who say that somewhere in their domains
lies a treasure like no other.
"
Obsidian Efreet,"Far from trusting the God of Fire, Zonte created the Efreets with an innate and
relentless hatred towards Djinns. In his first attempt, the legendary Mage was
too ambitious in his calculations, which caused this hatred to be replaced in the
Obsidian Efreet by an imperious necessity to destroy them. They can feel the
presence of Bjinns and create portals to their location through the ashes of their
enemies.
"
Occultist Spellbinder,"The Nether Orbs were the okjects of study that attracted the most attention. It
was Zonte who managed to confirm the first hypotheses, which suggested that
they could be residual energy left behind from the creation of the world.

Everyone who has seen more than one Occultist has thought they were the
same creature at first, as their features are always exactly the same. No spell is
unknown to the Occultist Spellbinder, but she can only cast them when
something makes her angry.
"
Oculum Leech,"Leeches reportedly feed on the blood of the dead creature that Mortem claimed
as his realm. They have been able to survive in this way for thousands of
years. On the other hand, it seems like the survival instincts of these creatures
have atrophied, or rather, were never really there in the first place.

Although the Oculum Leech is able to see through its eye, it does not
understand what it is seeing, and it is unable to use that information at all.
When it tries to feed, its sight intereferes with its sense of smell, so it often tries
to suck blood from a tree or a wall.
"
Omelette,"It was thousands of years ago when Omelettes first encountered humans.
Specifically, they were integrated into the society of Kaito, where they let
humans paint them during their rituals of birth and death. When that civilization
came to an end, the Omelettes dispersed throughout the world and tried to
befriend humans from other places. Many of these Dumplings had to pay a
great price before they became more than food for the humans, but they are
now considered sacred creatures in Rodia and other regions of the world.
"
Omnipotent Deity,"Demigods have innate powers that mortals can only dream of, and though
many of them are the same throughout the subspecies, most Demigods
choose one in particular to specialize in.

The Omnipotent Deity is very possessive of its belongings, especially of those
who fulfill its desires without question. If one of its sukjects is attacked or even
fails a mission, it will personally ensure that someone pays the consequences.
"
Oni-Goroshi,"These creatures are vengeful spirits that come from a very distant country.
Aiter being abandoned by their masters during a siege of the temple where
they lived and trained, they swore revenge before dying in that battle. Their
unshakable faith in their beliefs, coupled with the betrayal they felt and the
magic that floated there, made the last wish of these young warriors come true.
Once again on their feet, they dispersed and massacred both those who had
killed them and their own masters, who had abandoned them. However, their
thirst for blood did not go away, and they continue their indiscriminate slaughter
across the continent to this day.
"
Onyx Carbuncle,"Once the Watcher War was over, the Ravens tried to get in touch with the
Gods so they could intervene on behalf of the Carbuncles, but none of them
answered their demands.

Any magic item around a Carbuncle reacts to its presence in sometimes
imperceptible ways.

Onyx Carbuncles are curious and unruly, and they kept sneaking into human
homes to steal food or simply open the kitchen cupboards and throw everything
to the floor for fun, even when they were being hunted. When a magic item
touches their fur, it turns black permanently.
"
Oozing Leech,"When Mortem reached what is now known as the Titan's Wound, he found the
Leeches wandering inside the body of that strange, enormous creature.

A single drop of the substance this creature oozes is enough to wilt any kind of

plant. Profiteers from Andolin have recently managed to obtain several of these
creatures and spread their venom across dozens of acres of forest, destroying

them completely.
"
Oozing Warhog,"During the Brownie rebellion, a large number of Brownies used Warhogs as
mounts.

No other Warhog can camouflage itself better than the Oozing Warhog. It can
go unnoticed even when it is right next to a person, but it generally stays still
and waits for its would-be hunter to leave before running away.
"
Opal Paragon,"Before fighting Sigmund, Helmholtz and Milner started an experiment with their
Topaz and Diamond Paragons, using cutting-edge techniques of magical
engineering, as well as an opal and an amethyst. The result was two unique
Paragons designed specifically to help them defeat the (until recently) most
powerful dark lord of all time. When the Unification War ended, the Opal
Paragon asked Milner for its freedom and she accepted. Since then it has
worked as an advisor to the royal family in Neralim.
"
Ossein Defender,"Even though the body of an Ossein is made entirely of bone, they possess
extraordinary toughness due to the nature of the creature from whom they
emerged. This is more noticeable in the case of the Ossein Defenders, since
they often choose to block their enemies’ blows. No matter how many spells,
arrows and blades strike its shield, it is never damaged at the end of a fight.
"
Otherworldly Visitor,"During the years leading up to the Brownie Rebellion, some of them secretly
tried to learn magic, although this was never their strong suit. The day this
enslaved species took up arms, many performed a dangerous ritual with the
purpose of merging into a single and powerful being. As expected, it didn't work
out. A dimensional portal appeared above them and forcibly led them to
another world. For centuries they remained in that place lost in time, with
countless stars in the black velvet of its eternal night. Recently, two great
Rodian Magi encountered these creatures and informed them not only that the
Brownies were successful in their rebellion, but also that they were in Eternity's
End, the realm ruled by Vertraag, God of Time. The failed ritual had changed
them, and after so many generations they had learned to use a strange power
based on the accumulation of gravity under their hoods. The two Magi led
these creatures to Rodia, and most of them now live a simple life.
"
Ottum,"Ottum begin their lives as tiny parasites that burrow into the skulls of their prey
and feast on the brain matter found within. After they've consumed enough
food, they go into hiding for 6 years during which they grow into the
unstoppable killing machines we've grown to know and love.
"
Ovoid Vortex,"Aiter the Watcher War, some of the refugees from Kaito started a new life in
the Unsullied Meadows. Since the Dragons were too busy dealing with the
Watchers, Aeolian was the first to notice their presence... and the first to ask
them to abandon his realm. But he also knew of Kaito's plight, and seeing how
respectful those people had been gave him an idea: he would let them stay for
a generation before making a choice. When the time was up, Aeolian found
that the humans had not only survived while preserving nature, but also
improved the state of his realm wherever they had settled. Those refugees
became the first humans to live in the Unsullied Meadows. In a gesture of
gratitude and praise, Aeolian created the Ovoid Vortex to protect them, inspired
by the Omelettes that lived with the refugees.
"
Palace Familiar,"Adter their rebellion, many Familiars went north and established a community in
an old tower, inhabited only by Cornell and other Grimoires since the
Apollinaire Massacre. There, they filled the looted shelves with books of
science and magic.

Palace Familiars are distinguished members of their community, who
established the Council which decides on matters of trade, the provisioning of
the tower, and Familiar activities. In battle, they throw their scepters at their
enemies, then call their weapons back with telekinesis.
"
Paladin Crab,"For centuries, Lister watched the Imps of his realm overhunt shame-faced
crabs. One day, he opened his eyes and found one of these crustaceans
sleeping next to him. As time passed, more crabs gathered around him. They
had learned that being close to the God of Fortune was the easiest way for
them to survive. In time, Lister grew fond of them and finally decided these
animals needed protection. For this purpose he created the Paladin Crab, a
creature that would gladly give its life to prevent its weaker kin from being
eaten, no matter who dares to try.
"
Pandemonium King,"The Pandemonium King appears before those who tempt luck without good
intentions. Defeating it is not an easy task, as its body is made of fire and
stone, although it is thought that it is not aggressive to everyone.
Unsurprisingly, only experienced Magi have been able to deal with the creature
and live to tell the tale. A wealthy merchant once said he had brought it to
Rodia and, apparently, it simply went back the way it had come.
"
Pandemonium Queen,"This creature is a manifestation of Vulcanar's sense of humor, poured into his
Pandemonium Tokens in the form of a floating fortress that spits fire and
blazing rocks. Although harmless to most civilians, it can wreak havoc when
summoned in the middle of nature, even when it simply opens its mouth to
insult whoever summoned it. Specifically, Vulcanar thought it would be hilarious
if an adventurer made it appear in the middle of the Cutthroat Jungle to set the
trees on fire and make Torun mad.
"
Pandora,"The energy contained within Mimics is not always stable, and sometimes it
reaches a critical point and escapes outwards, turning them into a Pandora. It
was named by a prestigious, but very old and almost senile, scientist who
witnessed this transformation while studying Mimics. According to him, the
evils of the world had attracted the darkness of this creature, and it would
trigger the end of days.
"
Panic Hound,"Hounds are extremely agile, and their bite can pierce even iron. Moreover, they
are good strategists who divide their roles and know to turn tail and run when
they are at a disadvantage.

The Panic Hound fights differently from its packmates, running from side to
side without attacking directly. Then, swift as an arrow, it uses its tail to tear at
its enemies’ legs so that they lose balance, giving them a huge disadvantage
during battle.
"
Paranormal Slime,"Zonte convinced his teacher Ainsworth not to give the order to exterminate the
Slimes, as they were relatively harmless.

At night, the Paranormal Slime slides inside a bedroom and gets close to a
bed. There, it lights a candle and makes some noise. When the victims awake,
they watch in horror as this creature waves its hands and tongue. Finally, the
Paranormal Slime lets out a laugh and stumbles out of the house.
"
Parasitic Snaptrap,"When a Snaptrap devours a creature, it stores residual energy of the creature,
along with part of its memories, inside it to feed.

From the time they sprout to the moment of their death, Parasitic Snaptraps
have a host, which changes depending on their life cycle. They first sprout
inside a small rodent, and within a few weeks they switch to a larger bird or
mammal. It does not kill these hosts, although it does shorten their lives
significantly. When it reaches maturity, the creature digs its roots into other
plants and sucks them dry. On the contrary, even though it does feed on
insects that enter its jaws, it will only attack and devour other creatures if it has
no other choice.
"
Patientias Sanctus,"Sanctuses are considered a divine punishment by the people of Rodia;
terrifying beings that inspire a much greater fear than Sins or even Banshees.

Without a doubt, the worst punishment of all is inflicted by the Patientias
Sanctus. Those who are unable to control their anger turn into hybrid trees that
take root, condemned to remain motionless for hundreds of years without
losing their cognitive functions or their impulses.
"
Pegasus,"Many children in Rodia dream of becoming Magi and summoning a Pegasus
with which to soar the skies. They are extremely rare creatures that spend
most of their time in the clouds or on the peaks of high mountains, inaccessible
to most. They enjoy silence and tranquility, but they will immediately come to
the aid of people who cannot fend for themselves if they witness a catastrophe.
"
Pellucid Beacon,"Beacons do not interfere with the fauna and flora of the forest they inhabit.
However, visitors must be extremely careful, as Beacons have been known to
mercilessly attack together when they witnessed the slightest interference.

The Pellucid Beacon's colors flash with great intensity when it enters combat. It
uses this ability to make the direction of its movement more difficult to predict,
as well as to intimidate its enemies.
"
Perdition,"Vyre was the most skilled blademaster in Ankor, the country closest to Rodia.
His older sister, Sevalah, taught him the secrets of magic, and together they
protected the country from the hordes of the Great Pandemonium, who wanted
to destroy the church of Surathli that was so widespread in those lands. Vyre
had a calm demeanor and enjoyed meditating, unlike his sister, who spent all
her free time reading or investigating the mysteries of magic and the universe
itself. When the Auditors contacted them, Vyre flatly refused to belong to such
an organization, but after a long night talking to his sister, he accepted the offer
on the condition that they helped them destroy the enemies of Ankor. The
Auditors replied that the war would be long, and its outcome uncertain, were it
not for the fact that the organization had already begun to intervene a long time
ago. After joining them, Vyre was given the codename Dawn, and his sister
Sevalah was Gloom. Their first mission along with the other four members of
their group consisted, precisely, in thwarting the Great Pandemonium's plans
for these lands. Twelve years later, Vyre became Perdition and created the
Sanctum Umbra.
"
Perdition Guard,"Before the Unification War, Misery learned that they intended to share the
Torture Chamber among the several neighboring kingdoms. That was one of
the reasons why the King of Caedo fought against the unification, as it was
quite practical to have no need for prisons, instead sending people to that dark
place.

The Perdition Guard has keen senses that allow it to anticipate blows from
many sides at once.
"
Pestilence Crafter,"With the passage of time, some of the descendants of Disease Crafters
mutated into these creatures. Unlike their ancestors, they are not contagious
unless they want to be. Their powers have improved, and the diseases they
carry, as well as those around them, obey their will.
"
Pestilent Smog,"The explosion in Siralim's chemical plant disintegrated the body of the
prisoners of war, but their souls were locked in the gas masks they were forced
to wear during the workday.

At night, the Pestilent Smog approaches villages and unprotected camps to
look for sick people. When the smoke of this creature enters the organism, it
replicates a virus or a harmful substance inside it, preventing it from
disappearing.
"
Petrafortis,"This Golem was recently built to help in the forge, but its lack of technique and
its excessive strength quickly made it clear it is not well-suited for this purpose.
However, in battle it is a threat to be reckoned with. Just one of its blows can
crack a sturdy shield, and its metal armor allows it not to take any damage
from most blows. When it is in trouble, it uses its hammer-shaped hands to
deflect or black its enemies’ attacks.
"
Phase Champion,"Phase Warriors are remnants of people who once fought in important battles. A
powerful enchantment is needed to create them, and it can only be cast by a
competent Mage in exchange for their own life.

Every living being can produce a remnant. The Phase Champion has the
power to channel that possibility and use it to return the soul of a dead creature
to its body.
"
Phase Executioner,"The core of a Phase Warrior is the enchanted stone that makes it a remnant,
always floating over its head. The first stones to be used as a core for these
creatures were part of the castle of Siralim, when it was damaged during a
siege.

Phase Executioners are the remnants of reckless warriors who exposed
themselves in battle to unleash devastating attacks that captured the attention
of their enemies, allowing Magi to use their power freely.
"
Phase Knight,"No matter how damaged its armor is, a Phase Warrior will keep moving until its
core is destroyed.

The first Phase Knights belonged to the royal guard of Siralim, who sacrificed
themselves so that the young prince could escape from Sigmund. They are
honorable creatures that protect the innocent at the cost of taking damage. In
addition, their shield can absorb the effects of many spells.
"
Phase Marauder,"Phase Warriors obey the will of the Mage who gave them life, until after a few
hours that person heart's stops. From that point on, they will follow any master.

Phase Marauders are the remnants of the mercenaries that Sigmund hired to
besiege the city of Siralim at the end of the Unification War. He took the Queen
by surprise in this way, as his main army was in Omnia. These creatures are
skilled with all weapons, although they prefer melee combat.
"
Phase Paladin,"Centuries ago, during the critical phase of the Unification War, Sigmund
devastated the city of Siralim with a mercenary army and his extraordinary
power. The Queen returned with her most trusted Magi, but it was too late. She
had fallen into a trap.

Phase Paladins fight for just causes. They are remnants of warriors who
devoted their lives to the protection of the innocent. When they hit their shield
with their hammer, they generate a force field that can black the attacks of their
enemies.
"
Phase Rogue,"The Queen was running out of time. While the Phase Warriors invaded Omnia
with Vanelin's and Andolin's forces, she appeared at the gates of Sigmund's
castle and challenged him to single combat. The Queen lost her life but took
half of the dark lord's jaw with her.

During the siege of Siralim, a renowned criminal helped the royal guard protect
the prince. He was the last one standing and managed to escape Sigmund with
the child in his arms. But his shoulder had been pierced by a poisoned arrow.
"
Phase Spellblade,"With their army annihilated, the Queen of Siralim had no choice but to cast a
dangerous enchantment that would end her own life. The weapons and armor
of the fallen rose and joined the forces of Vanelin in the battle that would end
the Unification War.

Phase Spellblades are skilled warriors in both melee combat and magic.
Through specialized training based on the Red Hat order's, they are able to
channel spells through their weapons to hit harder.
"
Phobos Banshee,"There is a common misconception in Radia that the Phobos Banshee feeds on
the fear of other creatures. This rumor was initially spread by a doctor in
Neralim after she realized how scared people were of the creature. When the
doctor's colleagues found out what she was doing, they started to imitate her,
and in a few years people went from running away from this Banshee to getting
close to her, feeling more relaxed thanks to the placebo effect.
"
Pilwiz Guardian,"A considerable part of Radia's crops belongs to the Pilwiz. Despite being
farmers, the dangers of outdoor life in the country have forced these creatures
to learn how to defend themselves properly.

Pilwiz Guardians drive away any herbivorous animals and pests that try to feed
on the fruits of their labor during the day. When faced with dangerous
creatures, they lick the blood left in their scythes to heal their own wounds.
"
Pilwiz Harvester,"To perform any tasks that require fine motor skills, the Pilwiz developed a
series of rudimentary instruments that have been improved by humans over
the years.

Although all Pilwiz handle the harvest, there is one whose work in the field is
limited to it. The Pilwiz Harvester is a nomadic creature that compares the
results of the crops in the different regions of Rodia to assess what the best
products are and advise on subsequent sowings.
"
Pilwiz Herbalist,"Pilwiz that never farm are a rare, but necessary exception for the perfection of
the art of cultivation. The Pilwiz Herbalist's knowledge ranges from the genetic
engineering of plants through breeding to the study of their medicinal
properties. When a Pilwiz becomes seriously ill or unable to move, a bird is
sent to the nearest Herbalist's cabin to request its services.
"
Pilwiz Peasant,"When a Pilwiz reaches 7 years of age, the blades of its feet and hands begin to
develop. At 10 they are considered independent adults, and their blades reach
their maximum size.

Pilwiz Peasants are the most numerous of their species, and the ones in
charge of cultivating the fields. Many thieves underestimate their strength for
this reason, but they are as dangerous as any other Pilwiz, especially in single
combat, and they protect the fruit of their efforts with their own lives.
"
Pilwiz Slasher,"Pilwiz communicate with each other through a curious language made up of
hisses and croaks, reminiscent of the sounds of snakes and frogs. Maintaining
the monopoly of a product is a complex task that requires firm and constant
attention.

Pilwiz Slashers keep a low profile mast of the time, but they get moving when
they find out that someone plans to cultivate corn. These creatures are
bloodthirsty murderers that eliminate the competition in a whirlwind of sharp
strikes.
"
Pit Guard,"Rumors of Taylor's cruel eccentricities spread throughout the neighboring
territories after the construction of the Torture Chamber. When they reached
his mother's ears, she went into a deep depression and ended up taking her
own life. Heartbroken and tortured by guilt, Taylor's father set out on a journey
to solve the problem.

Doomguards possess endurance and vitality that few creatures can match.
Some, like the Pit Guard, can share this energy with their allies to protect them.
"
Pit Worm Gladiator,"Instead of falling into the supposed trap and sending the ships against the
Valkyries, Sigmund sent his army of Pit Worms against them. Helmholtz, who
already knew that many of these creatures were at his service, cast a spell that
made the ground harder so that the Pit Worms could not emerge from under
them as easily.

The more time a Pit Worm Gladiator spends in front of food (that is, any
creature), the greater its desire to devour it, and the more dangerous its bites
become.
"
Pit Worm Harbinger,"Pit Worms can eat almost anything, especially if it has a heart beating inside. If
they are properly trained and fed from a young age, they are easy to tame and
likely to become obedient creatures.

The Pit Worm Harbinger is perhaps the most intelligent of its kind. When it
finds prey, it does not attack directly, instead digging around it and modifying
the terrain to hinder its movement.
"
Pit Worm Tunneler,"Most Pit Worms live underground for the majority of their lives, feeding on roots
and subterranean creatures. When they feel vibrations coming from the
surface, they emerge for a moment to surprise whatever is producing them and
eat it... or die trying.

The Pit Worm Tunneler has caused the collapse of many Rodian mines, which
has forced the authorities to implement a protocol to deal with the problem,
employing their own Tunnelers to monitor the underground perimeter.
"
Pit Wraith Dominator,"Vertraag got the inspiration to create the Pit Wraiths after meeting Regalis's
Mite Paralyzer. He used the Transient Spectre, whose existence is
compressed in time, as a blueprint. These creatures possess very diverse
temporal abilities, and their presence is disturbing, perhaps solely due to their
appearance.

When the claws of a Pit Wraith Dominator tear the skin of an enemy, the flow
of time around the wound is accelerated, which makes the blood flow three
times faster.
"
Pit Wraith Liberator,"In order to create the Pit Wraiths, Vertraag did not spend a single drop of his
power. Instead, he created gravitational waves in his dimension, which caused
the Pit Wraiths to appear one by one in Eternity's End.

The Pit Wraith Liberator produces a temporal wave with its wings that slows
down its enemies’ movements. However, it is not very accurate, and it usually
misses if the target is moving around the battlefield.
"
Pit Wraith Lord,"Milner read about these mysterious creatures during her time in Neralim as an
exchange student and decided to investigate them. Pit Wraiths are timeless
creatures that cannot grow old. Moreover, they exist in several eras
simultaneously. If a version of them dies at some point in history, the others
disappear.

When the Pit Wraith Lord enters battle, its eyes shine with an unusual red
color. Temporal distortions begin to appear around it that send its enemies to
the immediate future, allowing it to strike them while they are unprepared.
However, it often finds it hard to use the same trick twice on the same
opponents.
"
Pit Wraith Obliterator,"Pit Wraiths fold and unfold spontaneously in different eras of history. On one
occasion, Baker lost her Pit Wraith in the middle of a fight against an Ira Sin.
When she tried to flee from the Magnificus Sanctus, it mysteriously reappeared
and gave its life so that she could escape.

A Pit Wraith Obliterator is a binary existence: one version exists an instant after
the other. It seems to leave an afterimage when it moves, but the weaker it
becomes, the less powerful its later version becomes.
"
Pit Wraith Overmind,"During her youth, Milner was romantically involved with the prince of Neralim.
Though it ended a few years later, their friendship endured, and she sometimes
escorted him in times of war. All Pit Wraiths have a trunk, though they have
never been seen feeding.

When a Pit Wraith Overmind stares at its opponents, it can return them to a
previous state or send them to a later one in which their body was or will be
fatigued. In addition, the victims are invaded by the memories of what was
happening or will happen at that moment, causing confusion and restlessness.
"
Pit Wraith Redeemer,"Before joining the Red Hat order, Milner graduated as Mage from the Magic
University of Vanelin thanks to a famous study about Pit Wraiths. She
discovered that these creatures feed on unconsolidated temporal energy. That
is, the residual energy left behind by decisions that, when taken, prevented
actions with great consequences.

The claws of a Pit Wraith Redeemer age its enemies considerably for thirty
seconds. A festival attraction in Andolin promises to show the ""future"" for a
couple of coins. The sign reads: ""Touch the hand of the beast and look in the
mirror!""
"
Pit Wraith Tormenter,"When Taylor decided to kill his father instead of forgiving him for abandoning
him, accidentally turning him into a God, a Pit Wraith fed on what he never
was. It automatically became the Tormenter. Tartarith and the creature looked
at each other for a moment, but before the God could think of killing it, it
unfolded before his eyes. The mere presence of this creature arouses vivid
images of a happy future in those who abandoned their loved ones, plunging
them into a deep sadness.
"
Plague Alchemist,"Plague Doctors have a strange fondness for traveling the world, curing any sick
creature they find.

When a Plague Alchemist finds a wounded person, it does not merely heal
their wounds. With a whisper, it asks the patient whether they were caused by
another. With just a description, this creature finds the perpetrator and waits for
them to become distracted. Then it pours the contents of its test tube into a
glass. When drunk, the strange liquid causes the same injuries on the
aggressor's body.
"
Plague Expert,"The first known appearance of the Plague Expert dates to the quarantine of
Andolin, but no one really knows for how long it had been traveling the world
before that. While its people cured the sick, the Expert wrote strange symbols
in its book that no one recognized. The presence of this creature is now a
beacon of hope, and it lifts the spirits of the people wherever it goes. Moreover,
it is believed that its book contains the supreme knowledge of medicine, and
many long to learn its secrets.
"
Plague Herbalist,"Plague Herbalists have a prodigious knowledge about the effects of plants.
Indeed, the healers of other species learned many of their secrets from them.

Plague Herbalists detest rulers who use their position to gain wealth and power
at the expense of the lives of their subjects. After a great victory, the Herbalist
sneaks under the banquet table, where it splashes a special compound,
imbued with its own power, that discourages the sovereign, making them lose
their will to continue fighting.
"
Plague Phlebotomist,"When these Plague Doctors find a badly injured person in risk of bleeding out,
they perform a blood transfusion. Indeed, humans and other intelligent species
learned this technique from them, as well as the fact that not all blood types are
compatible. If a Plague Phlebotomist's patient was injured unjustly by another
creature, it will sneak into their room while they are sleeping and draw all the
blood they can without ending the creature's life.
"
Plague Quack,"Plague Doctors are shy and quiet, and rarely communicate with other
creatures. They sometimes make gestures with their hands or move their
heads in a certain direction to point out materials and tools they need.

The Plague Quack hates fake doctors. It travels through towns and cities
looking for possible frauds, and when it finds one it simply heals the sick people
and disappears before the patients’ family members unleash their anger on the
imposter.
"
Plague Reaper,"Sigmund took advantage of his friendship with a Bone Reaper to experiment on
it. Unbeknownst to the creature, he kept casting relatively innocuous curses on
it until it transformed into a Cursed Reaper. When it happened it demanded
explanations, but Sigmund locked it up and continued casting progressively
more powerful spells on it. It finally became a Plague Reaper, bound to him as
a slave. This creature brings misfortune wherever it goes, and touching its
scythe horribly curses its victim.
"
Plague Scholar,"When the city of Andolin was quarantined because of a terrible disease, Plague
Doctors began to appear mysteriously. In less than a week, they healed the
sick and disappeared as quickly as they arrived.

Some wounds or illnesses are too serious for even a Plague Doctor to heal.
The Plague Scholar knows when to give up, but before doing so it prepares a
potion that emotionally relaxes the sick person and their closest people so that
they can calmly accept what is to come.
"
Plague Soothsayer,"Plague Doctors are believed to come from anather dimension. Nothing is
known about their reproductive cycle or their customs, and no one has seen
them sleep or settle anywhere.

Although it has great skill as a doctor, the Plague Soothsayer prefers to prevent
damage rather than repair it. Its main targets are criminal gangs, and it devotes
itself to investigate them and set traps. When the evildoers finally fall, the
Soothsayer gloats as it throws its coin in the air before its terrified victims.
"
Plague Surgeon,"To diagnose their patients, Plague Doctors observe them closely for a while,
explore their bodies, and demand information from the people around them,
pointing first to the patient and then to their mouths.

The Plague Surgeon is an expert in open-body surgery. Sometimes it finds that
a disease has been caused by someone else. In such cases, the author of the
damage awakens one morning with the same affliction, and no Plague Doctor
will watch over them.
"
Planetary Amaranth,"The Amaranths guided the first humans in the use of magic. However, as they
witnessed their selfishness and ambition, they stopped associating with them.
On one occasion, Helmholtz made a deep incision to a living Amaranth and
found that it was completely empty inside.

Regardless of the force with which a Planetary Amaranth is hit, it is never
knocked back. They are commonly seen after a bloody battle, observing those
who tend to the wounded.
"
Plated Warhog,"These days, only orcs bring large numbers of Warhags into battle.

The Plated Warhog is commonly targeted by poachers, as its fur is highly
prized on the black market. They became extinct in Siralim and Undolin over
two hundred years ago, before they were declared a protected species.
"
Polygala Fae,"Inside Yataka lie the Fae Lands, a dimension inhabited by fairies and other
magical creatures. It's obviously much bigger on the inside than it is on the
outside, and nothing has come in or out in all of history so far

Although their wings are blue, the trace left behind by the Polygala Fae is
purple. These creatures can jump so high that they don't need to fly to move at
high speeds, especially if there is enough vegetation. For this reason, they also
find it easier to attack their enemies without being detected, since they do not
leave a trail behind them, and the sound of their wings flapping cannot be
heard.
"
Pontiff of Luck,"This creature was made by a group of students from the Magic University of
Neralim during a drunken night, with the purpose of creating the ultimate billiard
player. Naturally, several things went wrong and they ended up giving life to a
creature obsessed with bar games, but with no special ability to excel in them,
who was also a sore loser and kept causing problems. Finally, the students
were made to clean the campus grounds for two weeks as punishment, and
the creature was released after the dean herself cast a powerful spell on it that
fixed its bad personality.
"
Possessed Cruncher,"Crunchers are slow creatures of low intelligence that simply try to eat anything
within their reach. For centuries, this ""anything"" was either Carbuncles, smaller
Crunchers, or any okject they found in their path.

Possessed Crunchers owe their name to the fact that, when they are asleep,
and they retract their head and legs inside their shell, it rises and moves on its
own, spinning mysteriously. Apparently, this is a defense mechanism to protect
them against predators while they sleep.
"
Preta Cherub,"To the followers of Surathli in particular, the Cherub holds special holy
significance. Their strong resemblence to unborn children early in development
leads many to believe that the Cherubs will, over time, gradually transform into
something far greater and more powerful. If there is any truth to this theory, the
fact that the Cherubs have changed little since their discovery suggests a
tremendously long transformation indeed.

Preta Cherubs are one of the more dangerous kinds of Cherub and by far the
most hostile to living creatures. One touch from its body can badly disrupt all
kinds of energies magical and mundane alike, leaving its prey in agony and
often well beyond saving. For such victims, the only ministration their comrades
can offer is a quick end to their suffering.
"
Priest Vizier,"Out of the eleven that existed in the beginning, only two of them retained most
of their power. As a mere gesture, Yseros contributed to the creation of the
world by creating the Barrens.

When the War Priests arrived, they began to undo the work of the other
Priests. This annoyed Lister, who created the Priest Vizier to persecute these
disdainful creatures and destroy them or at least drive them out of the cities.
Adter they finished their work, most of them moved to Ahruna to serve their lord.
"
Priest of Light,"When the first wars among the children of the Gods had ended, society began
to advance, and the first kingdoms were established. The formal study of magic
began around this time, and the first buildings exclusively dedicated to magic
activities were built.

The Priest of Light is a merciful creature that constantly seeks grief-stricken
humans and creatures to alleviate their pain with its mystical presence.
"
Priest of Radiance,"More than anything, Lister longed for world peace so that he could sleep
without worries. But from his kingdom, located between the ocean and the
Barrens, he watched as the children of the Gods murdered each other.

When the Priest of Radiance visited the human cities, it found powerful
individuals full of selfish desires that led innocents to their deaths on a whim.
This creature entered the castles of the great lords and diminished their
insatiable appetites.
"
Prismatic Cruncher,"The Prismatic Cruncher is a rare example of a Cruncher that was born from a
wall in which a Carbuncle had laid an egg. Unlike the rest of its kind, it only
feeds on rocks and metal, and it cares about the Carbuncles' well-being. Many
Carbuncles take advantage of the fact that the other Crunchers rarely attack
this creature and hide their eggs in the cracks of its shell. For this reason, it is a
multicolored creature whose pigmentation is determined by the species of
Carbuncle that laid the egg.
"
Prophetic Spectre,"Sigmund used the power of the Nether Orbs to cast his curse on Rodia. He
forced a part of Eternity's End to spill into the country through a rift, a huge
amount of temporal energy to which the dark lord gave form to terrorize the
world. During the process, one of the Orbs was corrupted and transformed into
this creature. It is believed that its existence is linked to the curse, that killing it
is one of the conditions to end it. Time is distorted around it, moving either
slower or faster.
"
Proto-Brachyura,"This terrifying creature dwells in the seafloor of the east Rodian seas.
Advances in the field of magic have long allowed it to walk on the surface
without drowning or exploding into a thousand pieces due to the pressure
differences between the two environments. It is very patient and can spend
hours, even days, lurking in the darkness while waiting for a fish to run into one
of its terrible pincers. However, this technique is useless on the surface, so it
will wait and wait without any prey approaching it until it starves.
"
Prowling Manticore,"The origin of Manticores can be traced back to an ancient rivalry between
humans and Nixes. The first human civilizations trembled at the brutality of
these creatures, but they endured. The last vestige of that frightful battle is the
Prowling Manticore, an immortal creature that still embodies one of the
greatest fears of mankind. It is almost seven feet tall, and its bite can easily
tear a person's head off, and it has a dangerous ability to travel between
realms and appear where it sees fit.
"
Proxigeist,"Electricity is beginning to be used in some countries on the continent where
Rodia is located, though there is still a long way to go. Indeed, magic is
involved in most of the research on this matter. It can be said that the
Proxigeist was a failed experiment, since the ritual that was supposed to
amplify the electrical power of some batteries ended up linking them to a ghost
that was nearby.
"
Psychic Vortex,"Vortices are not self-aware, but they have a natural instinct to protect the world
and to use their power to help their allies.

Time moves slower for the Psychic Vortex, which gives it time to read the
magical currents that are released before a spell is cast. This allows it to warn
its allies through a mental image of what is about to happen, giving them a
chance to avoid the spell.
"
Puffergryph,"This creature is not native to the country of Radia, but a couple of decades ago
it was introduced into one of its ecosystems by accident. River eels are their
favorite delicacy and they know very well how to get hold of them, which very
quickly has become an environmental problem, as these animals already had
natural predators in that environment. The kingdom of Neralim was
overwhelmed by this threat and had to ask the council for help four years ago,
so today there is a group of hunters who have specialized in killing this species.
"
Pulse Bat,"Their main means of orientation are the electromagnetic waves they emit
automatically at all times. They prefer to hunt at night, when most animals are
asleep, stealthily approaching them to suck their blood. According to biologist
Sprung Helthar, they are extremely aggressive during the mating season, as
their mating ritual consists of biting and clawing at each other to demonstrate
their strength, and they only procreate when they find an equally strong partner.
"
Pumking,"Despite its threatening appearance, the Pumking does not enjoy fighting, and
prefers to play practical jokes on the people around it. If, despite that, a Mage is
determined to make this creature part of their team, having a considerable
amount of sweets in their pantry is usually enough to keep its eccentricities at
bay. Otherwise, they may wake up the next morning to find all their clothes
replaced with bags of manure.
"
Purrghast,"A legend in Undolim tells of a spirit that steals people's lives and gives them to
cats until they have nine. After the Unification War, a boy watched from his
window as a hooded figure approached and touched a drunkard who was
walking down the street. The man collapsed onto the cobblestones as a cat
came out of a trash can and started grooming its paw. The boy's terrified gaze
soon met a pair of glowing eyes in the dark. The unknown figure removed its
hood, revealing a cat's head. ""Meow"", said the strange being. The boy
screamed so loud he woke up his family. His parents looked at each other in
disbelief as he told the story, but when they went out to look for the man they
believed had passed out from drunkenness, they found that he was indeed
dead.
"
Putrid Imling,"In their societies, one Imler and one Imling rule together over the others.
However, as Imlings are more intelligent, they make all of the decisions and let
the Imlers believe they are being a great help.

The mutant-like appearance of the Putrid Imling is actually to its advantage. It
is the only one of its species able to dive for hours without needing to breathe,
which allows it to easily search for food and treasure in lakes, rivers and
swamps.
"
Pyro Grimoire,"Aiter Apollinaire raided the Columbia Tower, mast of the Grimoires escaped
from their bookshelves and spread across the continent. Those who remained
hid everything they could in the basements to prevent looters from taking it.

Despite the fact that the Pyro Grimoire's spells have changed over the years,
they have always posed a fire risk. If a person without the necessary training
uses it, their body will burst into flames.
"
Quamar Tremor,"Tremors protect the creatures that live in the forests, plains and mountains.
When they get angry, they can cause small seismic movements by placing
their hands on the ground.

The Quamar Tremor can disintegrate stone at will, and there are always rings
of sand rotating around it. This creature throws this sand at its enemies’ eyes to
blind them temporarily, preventing them from taking any action.
"
Quarnok Tremor,"When it rains, Tremors remain motionless, completely relaxed. Unless a
defenseless animal is in danger, they will never move under these
circumstances. The forces of King Misery could not invade Neralim because
the city's commander deployed a large number of these creatures near the
walls to make the ground tremble, thus hindering the advance of the invading
troops.

A Quarnok Tremor can throw the racks of its body at high speed, and they
often hit its enemies’ heads when they stop moving.
"
Radiant Amaranth,"Humans quickly began to use magic in their battles. Although it was
rudimentary, the violence they unleashed knew no limits. It was enough to tear
the fabric of reality. While Gods, humans, and other creatures faced the
Watchers, the universe was shattered. Only the Amaranths noticed. They
gathered around the rifts and looked at the sky. They waited for weeks until the
night turned to day. The Radiant Amaranth descended, wrapped in a power
older than the universe. A power sacrificed to save it.
"
Ramun Rift Dancer,"Rift Dancers are intangible unless someone tries to touch them with either
positive or negative intentions.

The members of the Ramun subspecies are in constant pilgrimage, following
the wildest storms as if they were constantly seeking the gleam of the lightning
and the sound of the thunder. Some sailors claim to have seen them on their
voyages, acting as guides to let them know which routes were dangerous to
follow.
"
Rancid Imling,"Many Imlings considerably resemble Imlers. However, not all Imler embryos
react to magic in the same way, and some undergo major changes when
transformed into an Imling. In the case of the Rancid Imling, its pale skin did
not fully develop, but the cells of its body work at high speed, generating
excessive body heat that makes it sweat constantly.
"
Raptor Occultist,"The most ambitious prcject was directed by Zonte's master, Ainsworth, a Mage
that few have managed to match. The experiment was meant to replicate
Nether Orbs to unravel the enigma of creation and thus be able to create other
worlds without the help of the Gods. For this, she accepted the advice of
Vertraag.

Occultists sometimes try to eat or perform routine actions without success.
Raptor Occultists extract energy from Spell Gems without damaging them to
increase the power of their spells.
"
Rapturous Ghoul,"For a long time, Omnia was the most prosperous and beautiful city in the
world. A marvelous sight, which colors and architecture were beyond
imagination. High silver and glass towers, streets that ran at various heights,
lights that floated at night. From one day to another, it became a hotbed of
Ghouls and Forsaken, burnt and in ruins.

When a Rapturous Ghoul bites a victim, he does so while running, taking
advantage of his speed to tear off more tissue.
"
Raven Acolyte,"Raven civilization is as old as the world. They are very intelligent and cautious
beings, who recognized from the beginning the potential of their main
competitors: humans.

The stone in the staff of a Raven Acolyte is difficult to use, but in the right
hands it increases the effect of any spell. At present, many of them work
together with humans in the magic universities of the world.
"
Raven Batmaster,"Due to their biology, Ravens found it more difficult than humans to survive, and
their number has always been lower. Therefore, since the first cities were
founded the Ravens have peacefully lived with humans.

It is easy to distinguish a Raven Batmaster even from a distance, due to the
dark cloud that flits around it. It is a large colony of bats that constantly comes
and goes to warn it of the dangers that lurk in the surroundings.
"
Raven Bloodmage,"Even though most Ravens live together with humans, there is a city inhabited
almost exclusively by these creatures. Its name is Crux, and it was the first city
in history.

Raven Bloodmagi are selfish and aggressive, and they do not mind getting hurt
in order to increase the power of their magic. The stones in their staves were
initially created to close wounds and prevent bleeding, but these creatures
managed to reverse the effect with practice and perseverance.
"
Raven Defiler,"Ravens learned to use magic before humans. At first, they did not share that
knowledge for fear of being invaded. It was not until the construction of the
Refuge of the Magi that these creatures began to cooperate with humans.

The Raven Defiler carries around a human skull and spine for a reason. They
are against the supremacy of humans and often try to convince their kind and
other creatures to cause problems for them.
"
Raven Guardian,"Crux the Eternal City was the cradle of the study of magic in the world. When
the Watcher War came to an end, the Ravens made the decision to lock the
Watcher Sentinel within its walls to make sure it did not cause any problems.
Since then, there always was a Raven guarding its prison... until an old ruler of
Siralim invaded the city and damaged the walls that contained the Sentinel,
who managed to escape. The current Guardian's mission is to find it, alive, and
return it to Crux.
"
Raven Lord,"Raven culture promotes pacifism and tolerance, but many of them are
corrupted by power and follow other paths. Some of these creatures actually
form or lead powerful crime syndicates.

It is generally a Raven Lord who pulls the strings. They are smart, dangerous
and very ambitious. And they like attention. Indeed, neither their crown, red
stones or staff serve a purpose other than showing off their position of power.
"
Raven Ritualist,"The Ravens played a crucial role in the chain of events that took place during
the Watcher War. Their advanced knowledge of magic helped coordinate the
creatures that the Gods had created to deal with the threat.

The Raven Ritualist can sacrifice other creatures to absorb their vital energy
and strengthen itself for a limited time. The greater its power, the more victims
it can use at once for this purpose.
"
Raven Seer,"Raven Seers are seasoned psychics, capable of conjuring up images in other
creatures’ minds and reading their thoughts. Many of them take advantage of
their powers to offer what they call clairvoyance services in exchange for a lot
of money. Rodia's authorities pursue these activities, as they are considered
fraud, but not anyone can stop these creatures. Generally, one or two veteran
Magi with extensive knowledge of mentalism accompany the guard in charge
of arresting a Raven Seer who is committing this crime.
"
Raving Storm,"Despite their angry faces and their violent language, these creatures rarely
harm anyone, at least physically. Gonfurian thought that such indifference to
warlike activities was a waste of their appearance and bad manners. He
decided that at least one of them would act in accordance with what one would
expect from a thundercloud with a mean face. Torun never noticed the God of
War's interference, but he did appreciate the rage of the Raving Storm, which
quickly became his favorite.
"
Razorfoot Griffon,"As their average lifespan exceeds 150 years, Griffons are usually involved in
hundreds of battles throughout their lives. In the final stage of their life cycle,
the claws of many Griffons are heavily deteriorated because of these battles.
Some of these Griffons add sharp blades to their claws, obtained from
defeated enemies, so that they can keep being active members of their flock.
"
Razorweb Arachnalisk,"Some Arachnalisks are capable of producing a very hard web, as sharp as a
knife or a sword. They are known as Razorweb Arachnalisks, and instead of
attacking their enemies with their claws or fangs, they do so with their own
special webs, although they cannot weave them in large quantities. These
weapons can be thrown as if they were spears, as well as serving as a melee
weapon.
"
Reclusa,"Even though everyone knows that she is really the Goddess of Luck, she
prefers the term ""Uncertainty"" simply because she thinks it sounds more
mysterious and cool. Her realm has been visited since practically the very first
moment it was created, and it quickly became famous since, in short, it is a
casino. Her games of chance have raised controversy among the different
nations of the world, and some recommend their citizens not to try their luck at
the games of chance that proliferate there. Of course, there is no shortage of
thieves and murderers there, but most criminals follow a code dictated
centuries ago by a famous pirate named Rainer that forbids crime in Reclusa's
domain on pain of death.
"
Reclusive Wight,"Reclusive Wights are an exception among their kind, who do not seek revenge
for lost wars, but redemption. They travel the plains day and night, and though
their appearance does not make it easy for them to make friends, some have
managed to settle in some villages thanks to their good deeds. However,
although many of them prefer to earn an honest living taking care of livestock
or helping with the harvest, some still retain their warrior spirit and would not
refuse having a great adventure.
"
Red Storm,"When a Storm gets angry with its master, it often decides to rain in the middle
of the living room while cursing loudly. They snore when they sleep, which
produces quiet thunder sounds that some people actually find relaxing, though
they also grumble from time to time.

Whenever a Red Storm meets a Blood Slime, they play by casting spells and
lightning bolts at each other. If something threatens or scares its playmate, the
Red Storm unleashes all its fury.
"
Redsteel Construct,"When an old ruler of Siralim began the conquest of Radia, llberd advised the
King of Nex to propose to the Council of Sovereigns the construction of
automatons designed to defend the country. The prcject was named MK.

The Redsteel Construct can easily detach parts of its body and forge weapons
of acceptable quality in a matter of seconds. This allows civilians and soldiers
to arm themselves quickly if they have lost their weapon or do not have one. It
can restore the missing parts of its body simply by getting close to red-hot steel.
"
Redstone Imler,"Some cities employ Imlers to load and unload heavy equipment or as
construction workers. Some others treat them as slaves for the same purposes.

No Imler digs as fast as the Redstone Imler. Indeed, unless the ground is too
solid, they can use their extraordinary strength to dig a hole in a few seconds,
emerging somewhere else and catching their enemies by surprise.
"
Regal Golem,"This Golem's purpose is to protect the lives of its allies at any cost. Although, in
theory, they should not have feelings or a conscience, they have been known to
smile after assisting someone in need. According to a Mage's account from a
few decades ago, her Regal Golem showed reluctance to leave a village they
were passing through. The following night, the village was attacked by a Carver
Shadowstalker that murdered the entire population.
"
Regalis,"Since the beginning of time, the Goddess of Poison, also known as the Spider
Queen, has maintained a certain rivalry with Vertraag that no mortal would
describe as friendly. On one occasion, Regalis presented the Gad of Time with
a huge statue of himself, but the inside was hollow and contained millions of
spider eggs. When someone is caught in the webs of the Arachnid Nest,
Regalis considers them her property, and she keeps certain individuals she
likes as her slaves.
"
Rengas,"Rengas is often considered the little brother of Genaros, but he is really his first
and only son, the only creature the God of Strife has ever given life to. He is
good-natured and, unlike his father, does not get carried away with anger
easily. He helps travelers in distress by guiding them to safe places or pointing
out where they can find something to eat, but if he discovers that their
intentions are looting or indiscriminate violence he will charge with all of his
strength without a second thought.
"
Revenant Cabalist,"Revenants live in warrior tribes in the depths of the oceans. A thousand years
ago they developed the necessary magic to live on the surface, and many
abandoned their home to earn a living as mercenaries.

Revenant Kings are often surrounded by a group of loyal protectors called
Cabalists. They identify and dismantle conspiracies that threaten the King,
generally through violence. In addition, they are skilled magic users who can
sacrifice their own vitality to cast multiple spells at once.
"
Revenant Captain,"The number of Revenants that live underwater is unknown. However, several
studies financed by the government of Omnia centuries ago determined that
their population easily doubled that of surface creatures.

The Revenant Captain's shield is a powerful artifact that is rarely used for
protection. Learning how to wield it requires a lot of effort and training for
several years. With practice, the wielder can channel the pain from its wounds
to deliver devastating blows on its enemies.
"
Revenant Dagon,"Although the Revenants have always been at war with each other, there is a
sacred code that applies to all of them, and a council that punishes the infidels.
When a group of Revenants decided to live in peace in Ahruna with humans
and other creatures of the surface, Dagon emerged from the depths to punish
them. With a simple glance of this creature, their bodies began to experience
drastic changes. They grew legs, their scales became skin, and they were
completely transformed into humans.
"
Revenant Horror,"If the Revenants from every ocean joined to conquer the surface, it is very likely
that they would succeed due to their numbers. Luckily, they are an extremely
divided people who have but a few kingdoms.

The Revenant Horror pushes its weapon against their enemies’ necks, then
drives it into the wall to prevent their movements. Once its enemies are
subdued, it locks eyes with them to provoke irrational and terrifying thoughts
that convince them that they are about to transform into a Revenant.
"
Revenant King,"Most Revenants live in small tribes that are in constant war with each other.
When these groups contain more than one hundred creatures, several of them
proclaim themselves Kings. Naturally, the result is a battle to the death in which
only the survivor goes on to govern the other Revenants. If it manages to
consolidate its position as a leader, a Revenant King will never lose the respect
of its people, who will obey its orders without questioning them and even give
their lives to protect it.
"
Revenant Sealord,"Due to their inability to communicate verbally with the creatures on the surface,
Revenants began to use their hands to communicate through gestures. In time,
they created a sign language that is now common throughout the world.

Revenant Sealords are expert magic users who are in charge of teaching its
mysteries to the next generations. However, their strength is comparable to a
warrior's, as they use their arcane knowledge to amplify the power of their
staves.
"
Revenant Soldier,"A powerful tribe of Revenants once tried to invade the kingdom of Ahruna. The
Desert Priest quickly mobilized its army, and in a matter of hours the
Revenants were divided between those who wanted to continue with the
invasion and those who did not.

Revenant Soldiers form the bulk of the deep-sea armies. They are reckless
warriors with great physical strength who attack their enemies without worrying
about their own safety.
"
Rhododendron Fae,"The Fae Lands is a lush forest where day and night cycles are ten times longer.
When it gets dark, the mushrooms that sprout on many of its trees emit a
fluorescent light in many colors.

The Rhododendron Fae's flapping makes no sound. In addition, they are
capable of altering both the intensity and the color of their trails, naturally pink,
and are even able to make them invisible. Even at night, a Fae's trail is not
visible at great distances, especially in the thicket, but this ability makes
Rhododendron Fae virtually undetectable and the best creatures for a surprise
attack.
"
Rift Watcher,"Watchers were the first real threat to this world because of their superior
knowledge of magic. When they arrived, they appeared to be playful and
harmless creatures. Some even thought they were a gift from the Gods. But
when their numbers were large enough, they mercilessly attacked the first
human cities and reduced them to ashes and rubble.

Rift Watchers like rocky caves, where they usually join a colony of bats,
sleeping next to them and chasing away their predators.
"
Rimefist Yeti,"The ice club that this creature carries has mystical properties. It is believed to
contain the core of a Coldslam Yeti, though the Rimefist can only channel its
powers to summon blizzards during battle. Some Magi have tried to replicate
its effects, but the only thing they have achieved after hours of meticulous study
and experiments is a puddle of cold water on their tables.
"
Rimeskin Spellmane,"Spellmanes are extremely territorial, and they do not tolerate under any
circumstances the presence of another member of their species, unless it is
their offspring.

The Frostbite Caverns are home to the Rimeskin. To hunt travelers and other
creatures, they very often scale the icy walls with their sharp claws to climb to
the ceiling, posing as stalactites. When their prey passes under them, they only
have to drop down to end its life in a quick and grisly way.
"
Ritual Abomination,"The movements of an Abomination's bady are controlled by the main head.
However, the task of casting spells falls to the secondary head, and sometimes
they find it hard to agree on what to do during battle.

Free Ritual Abominations often gather in the Unsullied Meadows to gaze at the
stars in silence. During that time, they have access to each other's minds and
share their thoughts of peace and serenity.
"
Roaring Basilisk,"The mane and scales of the Basilisks make them greatly resilient. If they are
attacked from behind, they lean on their claws and deliver a powerful whiplash
with the rest of their bodies.

Roaring Basilisks have the mast powerful voice of their kind. When they are
young and cannot control their power, their voice makes everyone around them
faint. It takes these creatures years of practice to avoid knocking out their allies
as well as their enemies.
"
Rock Imling,"Occasionally, the embryo of a Boulder Imler that is exposed to magic is not
severely affected by it. The result is a cocky, mischievous Imling of greater
physical strength who likes to dig with Imlers, using its powerful horn to remove
dirt and break rocks. Despite its arrogant attitude, it often encourages a Marble
Imler to help it with easy physical tasks so that it does not feel different from its
kind.
"
Rockmoss Gemling,"Dragan was certain that once he opened the portal to the dimension where the
Carbuncles had lived in peace for centuries, the Gemlings would cross it to
guard them at all costs. Fortunately, he was not wrong.

Most Gemlings levitate and move quickly among other creatures. However,
Rockmoss Gemlings never leave the ground, and instead try to run into their
enemies to make them fall.
"
Roofstalker Wight,"It was first seen in Undolim, on top of the temple of Surathli. It was described
as an elusive specter that disappeared when its presence was perceived by too
many. During the night of the winter solstice, a child discovered a large number
of these creatures walking on the roofs. Luckily, her mother verified that it was
true and immediately notified the authorities, preventing the Roofstalker Wights
from massacring the faithful who were preparing to celebrate the festivities in
the temple.
"
Roost Watcher,"This creature specializes in sneaking into mansions and castles at night. It
wanders around the corridors, waiting for someone to get up for a visit to the
pantry or to empty the bladder. It uses its knowledge of light to cast a long
shadow on the ground, scaring anyone who sees it. When they are terrified
enough to ignite a stronger light, it suddenly appears in front of them with its
characteristic smile and attacks with a powerful spell.
"
Roseaea Fae,"Fae are peaceful and joyful creatures who do not know envy or greed. They are
intelligent and help any creature who needs it... as long as it is not the prey of
another Fae.

The most aggressive Fae are undoubtedly Roseae fae. Not only are they the
first to go on the attack, but they also lead the others into battle and continually
shout to boost the morale of all their allies.
"
Rosy Beacon,"Beacons feed only on flowers, but are able to survive by eating just a few every
day. To maintain the forest's balance, they often plant trees and shrubs so that
other species are not affected by their presence. All beacons participate in this
activity, but the Rosy Beacon has the most important role in it, as it is the only
one who can create flowers with its power. In this way, it can help the bees with
pollination, or its own kind to feed themselves on a particularly rough year.
"
Rotten Carnage,"Although a Carnage's murderous instinct cannot be suppressed, it can be
tamed to obey its master from a young age. Of course, their masters are
sometimes surprised by a sudden attack from their pet, a surprise that lasts but
a brief moment before they die.

The Rotten Carnage is always shedding its skin, and it needs to eat often to
prevent its entire body from rotting away.
"
Royal Phoenix,"Despite their evasive behavior, there are a few men and women who have
established a special bond with a Phoenix. They are known as Phoenix
Knights, and they ride on the backs of these creatures to enforce justice.

When a creature is resurrected, a small discharge of space-time energy is
generated around it. A Royal Phoenix can concentrate this energy on the
recently-revived creature to make it incredibly fast for a few moments.
"
Ruby Carbuncle,"The Ravens were firmly determined to protect the Carbuncles from the
humans, which led them to discover certain secrets about dimensional magic
which were very advanced for their time. That, especially, caught Vertraag's
attention.

The fur of a Ruby Carbuncle prevents heat loss even in very cold temperatures,
so other than plucking the gem on their foreheads, humans also skinned them
to make clothes. They stopped doing so when it was discovered that in the long
term, clothes made from their fur caused human skin to dry and peel off.
"
Ruby Paragon,"Every Paragon gives off a powerful magic aura that can turn the tides in battle.
During the Unification War, the Paragons chose their battles well and helped
the side that wanted to unify the kingdoms into a great nation.

The Ruby Paragon values peace and tranquility above all things and condemns
violence. During the Unification War, an important battle in Neralim was lost
because these creatures decided to protect the civilians inside, rather than
forming lines outside the city.
"
Runic Grimoire,"Grimoires love being read and enjoy being transported along with other books.
When they find an individual that is willing to read their pages, these creatures
usually stay by their side forever, unless abandoned.

When Apollinaire left the Columbia Tower, the Hidden Grimoire and the rest of
them who decided to stay took the ripped pages from the Necro Grimoire and
used them to give life to the Runic Grimoire.
"
Ryetrap,"Shortly after their organization was founded, the Auditors observed a
phenomenon that seemed to occur all over the world, and that often
manifested in the royal families of Rodia's kingdoms.

Due to the dangerous ability of Alementals to get people drunk, liberd advised
the ruler of Nex to forbid the owners of these creatures from setting them free.

Although its body is made of beer, the Venus Ryetrap is terrified of fire, as it is
aware of the damage it can cause to the forests. It remains motionless at night,
and some believe it is stalking prey, but it simply has its eyes fixed on a torch.
"
Sabertooth Manticore,"The bite of the Sabertooth Manticore is as good as that of the Martyaxwar, but
its fangs are so durable that they can also block sharp weapons as if they were
a shield. Sooner or later, the fangs suffer visible damage or even break off.
Luckily for this creature, it can shed them once a month, and they only take
four days to regrow, as strong as they were before.
"
Sadomasochist,"Finding the Torture Chamber was easy for the seven Rodian adventurers, but
traversing its corridors turned out to be harder. Together they had to defeat not
only Tartarith's Doomguards, but also the worst criminals in the country who
had been sent there.

Even in the most difficult battles, the Sadomasachist prefers to cause endless
superficial wounds to make its enemies suffer instead of killing them.
"
Sand Giant,"Giants have a tough, violent and utterly disrespectful personality, as well as a
mean face, all in the image and likeness of their one true God.

Thanks to the composition of its body, the Sand Giant can regenerate any of its
limbs in a matter of seconds as long as it is still alive. When Vulcanar saw this
huge and ""I@#$ING MAJESTIC"" creature, he decided to ignore the advice of
the Goddess of Illusion and create something that stood out even more in order
to irritate the God of Anger.
"
Sandstone Imler,"Imlers are not known for their cunning, but for their brute force. Imlings may
take advantage of them when making decisions or sharing benefits, but they
generally ensure their welfare.

The devotion that the Sandstone Imler feels toward Imlings prevents it from
distrusting them, even if its closest Imling partner warns it of some trick.
"
Sanguine Masochist,"As they walk the endless corridors of the Torture Chamber, mast visitors feel
their morale weaken with every step. Blood-stained walls, darkness lurking
behind every corner, heartbreaking howls, and, above all, the smell of death.
No one forgets the smell of death.

In spite of its diabolical appearance, the blood of the Sanguine Masochist has
healing properties and can undo most curses. In another time, this creature
may have been a talented Life Mage.
"
Sapphire Carbuncle,"It took half of the Raven population of Crux to build a new home for the
Carbuncles. When the ritual began, trails of light quickly shot into the air over
the squawks and arcane movements that guided the magic towards its
manifestation. But Vertraag had not revealed the price they would pay. When
the door to the new world opened at the top of the city's magic palace, the
Ravens who had participated in its creation lost their lives and collapsed on the
cobblestones of their own home. A few, perhaps fortunately, managed to see
the Carbuncles start their long journey before closing their eyes forever.

The Sapphire Carbuncle appeared after that and stayed with the Ravens,
guarding the Rod of Ruin for thousands of years. However, now that the
Temple of Lies is accessible, it has joined its kind to protect their lives.
"
Sapphire Paragon,"Adter the unification of Rodia, most Paragons left the military to devote
themselves to other activities. Some had forgotten their true purpose, corrupted
by the selfish desires they had learned from humans.

The Sapphire Paragon's body is the most resilient of its species. An
extraordinary force is necessary to damage it. In addition, even glass and
porcelain seem to be made of stone when this creature is near.
"
Satyr Dominator,"Like the people of Vanelin, Satyrs have extensive knowledge of the art of war.
They are great strategists and always in control of the battlefield, making it
almost impossible to catch them off guard.

For some reason, some Satyrs are born with two extra arms. These Satyr
Dominators are much more aggressive and crave battle above all else, leading
them to always be on the frontlines, and also to suffer a greater number of
wounds.
"
Satyr Guardian,"Satyrs soon began trading with the other intelligent species of the Blood Grove
— the Inquisitors. They traded fruit, cattle, tools, and knowledge for silk,
different cattle and a variety of metals and minerals.

To safeguard the well-being of their people, some Satyrs protect the most
vulnerable areas from attack, but Satyr Guardians are never alone. Whether
they like it or not, the nature of the Unleashed Satyrs has made collaboration
between the two a necessity.
"
Satyr Rammer,"The Satyrs built passages that connect the strongest trees to the underground
world, inhabited by the Inquisitors. To do this, they emptied the interior of these
trees and built ladders to allow easy access between the treetops and the
underground.

These creatures charge head on regardless of the size or strength of their
opponent, taking advantage of their horns. If a Satyr town suffers a massive
attack, they jump from the trees and plummet to the ground, sacrificing
themselves while taking several Ets with them.
"
Satyr Squire,"Satyrs originally came from the kingdom of Vanelin, fruit of the union of the
barbarian tribes and the great northern cities of what would later be known as
Rodia. Because of this, their worship of the Gods is somewhat contradictory,
given that they routinely worship Gonfurian as well as Aeolian and Surathli, two
deities who do not share the God of War's taste for blood. However, some
Satyrs such as Rammers and the Unleashed prefer the teachings of Gonfurian.

Satyr Squires guard the backs of their most fearless Satyr allies, especially the
Unleashed. Furthermore, they frequently patrol the suspension bridges and
wooden walkways that link their treetop homes to ensure no Efts have climbed
up to unleash chaos.
"
Saurel,"These creatures are the only ones Reclusa has given life to, and they are found
throughout the Gambler's Hive. Their main job is to work as dealers, and they
will not hesitate to punish anyone who cheats, sparks altercations or shows
violent discontent. They are quiet and extremely serious, and rarely
communicate for anything other than the games they run. In their spare time,
they read and discuss various topics with other Saurel. Many of them have
written books and poems, some of them famous in nations like Rodia or
Kiaces, to the point of being among the best sellers.
"
Savage Banshee,"This creature emerged from the pieces of the first God of Darkness's skull.
Unlike other Banshees, it is very aggressive and tries to destroy everything in
its path. Its screams can stop the heart of a weak-willed person, and a touch of
its hand leads even the happiest people to despair. Aware of the danger this
creature posed, Erebyss decided to destroy it. However, it has managed to
regenerate over the centuries, and soon the time will come for it to sow chaos
in Rodia.
"
Sawback Manticore,"Manticores were a calamity for humans during the rise of their early
civilizations. Today, children are still warned of the dangers that these creatures
entail.

The Sawback Manticore shows many openings while it fights, waiting for its
opponent to strike before crouching and becoming a deadly trap. It can also roll
across the floor like a spiked ball and throw itself on its enemies if they are far
enough.
"
Scheming Wisp,"Adter a preliminary investigation of the Wisps, there are reasons to believe they
are creatures born from the residual energy of all the curses cast since the
creatures of this world began to use magic.

Of all Wisps, the Scheming Wisp takes revenge in the most elaborate ways. A
wealthy citizen of Undolim reported that, after having buried her sister, she
found her body lying in the middle of the hall at night. The body's eyes
suddenly flashed blue and it stood up, pulling a knife from its dress. Although
the woman managed to defend against her sister's possessed body until some
Gargoyles subdued it, the authorities in the capital found out days later that she
had poisoned her sister so she could collect the entire inheritance.
"
Scotchpion,"Aiter ascending to godhood, the ruler of Siralim's ambition and arrogance were
completely unleashed. As punishment for drinking too much, Siralim's
tavernkeeper was transformed into a terrible creature.

The people of Radia find it hard to describe the personality of Alementals,
mainly because they were recently created. The Scotchpion is a dangerous
beast that is fortunately never found in the wild. Its aggressive nature drives it
to break everything in half, and its stinger can inflict serious injuries and a state
of instant inebriation.
"
Scourge Mummy,"The priests and priestesses of Kaito often practiced low-level magic. They
knew how to enchant items, perform rituals and even developed a power curse,
whose scope they completely ignored.

The Scourge Mummy's target was not the humans. At least, not directly. When
this creature entered a town or a city, it touched the walls of the houses,
starting countless fires.
"
Scourge Ossein,"There is some debate about the possibility of certain creatures, such as
Golems and Osseins, being sentient. The latter species also shows behaviors
that contradict its supposed automaton nature. This is more pronounced in the
Scourge Ossein now that a few specimens have begun to live in more diverse
environments that look nothing like the Titan's Wound. This breed prefers to

live in forests and reefs full of life, which it never attacks under any
circumstances, even when it is sometimes bitten or clawed at. However,
anyone who threatens these ecosystems will meet a premature and bloody end.
"
Scourge Smog,"The Smogs are entities blinded by rage, who seek revenge against all the
inhabitants of Rodia. They are a constant problem for the humans and Pilwiz
who work the land, because of the resentment they feel toward these activities.
For their part, farmers especially detest the Scourge Smog, as the red smoke it
emits can quickly dehydrate the crops. Entire harvests have been lost because
of these creatures.
"
Sentry Bot,"If the Auditors"" goal of bringing peace to the world were fulfilled, the next step
would be to apply what they learned at Ubi Concordia to improve the quality of
life of all creatures.

Sentry Bots patrol the streets of Ubi Concordia at all times in search of
lawbreakers, though their laws are quite lax, focused on not harming others or
the environment. These sentries speak in a metallic voice while a green light
moves from left to right in their visors.
"
Sentry Guard,"Five years after the construction of the Torture Chamber, Taylor became
interested in Nether Orbs. He was the first to study them, and he soon received
a visit from Vertraag, who said he was fascinated by his prowess both as a
Mage and a murderer and offered him the opportunity to become a God. In his
arrogance, he accepted, then organized a tournament to celebrate the
occasion. The winner, a veteran warrior from Sithicus, was led to Taylor's
chambers, where he turned him into the Sentry Guard.
"
Servant Hunter,"Sometimes, a group of Hunters is defeated by other creatures or by the ruler of
a kingdom on their way to conquer all of Radia. If one of them survives, it will
look for another group of Hunters to join so that it can be among its own and
survive. However, when this happens, it becomes the lowest in the hierarchy of
the group and must obey every order it receives.
"
Shackled Gargantuan,"When Torun was creating the Gargantuans, he used his power indiscriminately
over different mountains. One of them was cursed, and this creature was born.
It woke up full of unbridled rage and began to destroy everything in its path.
Torun was disappointed, as it is not necessary to kill mortals to humiliate them.
However, he also felt pity. He finally decided to chain it and leave it hidden,
hoping that it would change its attitude over time. It only took two days for him
to forget about it.
"
Shadow Carnage,"Carnages can perfectly adapt to any situation, making use of their seven limbs
or their terrible jaws depending on their enemy's skill. One of them could
massacre a small town without much difficulty. It is for this reason that Erebyss
forbade them from getting close to civilization unless it is under the command
of a person wha can control them... or until she rescinds the order.

The Shadow Carnage can open portals to and from the Path of the Damned
and catch its enemies by surprise.
"
Shadow Cobra,"There once was a smart young man who decided to play with shadows. His
prcject was an ambitious one; his talent, engraved in his blood.

Like other animal Shadows, the Shadow Cobra has kept its instincts, but is now
much more dangerous due fo its large size. That's why they are a precious
asset for adventurers and thugs, as they are easy to train for battle.
"
Shadow Demon,"The boy's obsession was such that he would not settle for anything less than
complete mastery over the shadows. Over time, he learned to control them, to
give them shape, to alter their size.

Unlike most normal Gargoyles, Shadow Demons do not care about keeping
innocent people safe at night. Instead, they are dedicated exclusively to murder;
and they learn fast. Some have already infiltrated the capital of Undolim,
pretending to be other Gargoyles’ shadows until the moment an unsuspecting
person turns their back.
"
Shadow Juggernaut,"Aiter a few months, the boy managed to make his own shadow interact with
the physical world, first by moving small objects, then by holding them. But
those were only his first steps.

The Shadow Juggernaut glides across surfaces at full speed, like a black stain
that portends disaster. It may look light, even flimsy, but when it rises from the
ground it rises as a calamity. Its fists can shatter stone and pulverize bone, and
it can effortlessly charge through walls, smashing anyone who gets in its way.
"
Shadow Moth,"A year had passed since the Shadows became that boy's whole life, and he
had completely mastered them. With them, he scared his neighbors and
schoolmates, and occasionally made the Shadows hit them when they made
him angry.

Shadow Moths have started to worry the local authorities. Although their
behaviour is mastly the same as that of normal moths, their large size frightens
the locals, who often anger these creatures when trying to scare them away,
causing them to attack. It has recently been found that luckily, the creatures
who can create other Shadows can only do so once a day.
"
Shadow Reaper,"Reapers are intelligent beings who know all kinds of languages. However, they
consider the concerns of mortals trivial and rarely communicate with them.

It is believed that the Shadow Reapers are the purest of their species. When
their scythes take a life before its time had come, they generate a space-time
distortion that accelerates the aging process of any creatures around them.
During his investigations, Zonte designed a spell to reverse this effect.
"
Shadow Wolf,"Adter all his hard work, the young man learned how to enter his own shadow.
He could move across the floor and walls like a light breeze; he felt weightless
and free, as if he could fly.

A lone Shadow Wolf may not be a big threat to an average adventurer, but
these creatures tend to band together in small groups in the wilderness, and
rarely hunt unaccompanied. For this reason, straying far from the roads of
some regions, especially in the kingdom of Andolin, is tantamount to suicide.
Shadow Wolf packs sneak through the woods, stalking their prey, who never
realize the danger before being surrounded by their jaws.
"
Shadow Zealot,"But one day, he went too far. He decided that his mastery would not be
complete until he could separate the shadows themselves from their bodies. To
achieve his goal, he developed an item, a knife imbued with now-forbidden
magic. Blade in hand, he cut his own shadow, separating it from himself and
cutting off his soul and his sanity. His body fell to the ground, lifeless, and his
Shadow rose in a frenzy. A Shadow who could create other Shadows like itself.
A Shadow who could dominate them and call them to war. A Shadow that,
finally, was sealed away along with the army it had gathered.
"
Shallan,"Unlike the Fae, Shallan is quiet and calm. She spends most of her time lying
down or flying slowly while watching over her realm, although she does
occasionally approach other creatures to play with them, tell stories, or simply
strike up conversation. Now that the Auditors have found a way into the realm,
she is not at all happy due to the influx of looters. She has ordered all Fae to
attack any intruder, especially those who try to cut down trees or take the
creatures that inhabit the Fae Lands.
"
Shambler Benefactor,"James's pirates once went underwater to visit small Revenant settlements. In
one of their temples, they found engravings of creatures none of them had ever
seen before. According to Revenant culture, it was an intelligent species who
inhabited the Boreal Ocean and went extinct thousands of years ago. Their
knowledge of magic rivaled that of the Ravens, and they tried to rule over the
depths until, one day, they suddenly stopped attacking the Revenants.

The Shambler Benefactor is all that is left of that species, and it has lost all
vestige of its former intelligence. James's pirates jokingly decided to name it
Benefactor, as they never would have become undead had it not been for its
curse.
"
Shambler Juggernaut,"About half of William James's fleet was lost in the waters, not because of a
storm, but because of the creature who kept grabbing the ships that survived its
attacks. That forgotten, grotesque beast, larger than any boat, was named the
Shambler Juggernaut after the pirate captain and his comrades finally
managed to subdue it. Soon after landing in Rodia, the captured Juggernaut
they had carried with them laid a clutch of eggs, and the pirates, wanting to
rebuild their fleet, decided to sell them. Like their mother, these new
Juggernauts are fearsome foes both on water and dry land, but also very easy
to tame.
"
Shambler Recruiter,"When William James told the dean of the Magic University of Ahruna about his
curse, the dean raised the possibility that perhaps the treasure had only ended
their lives, but they were unable to die due to the curse in those waters.

Like the Amorphous Shambler, the Recruiter can float in midair; and like the
Innocent, it tries to devour prey from time to time. On many occasions, they
simply gobble up birds or fish, who come out the other end of their jaws without
much difficulty. Others get caught between the ribs by accident and cannot get
out. This is how they first found the Benefactor, and in gratitude and laughter
they named this creature ""Recruiter"".
"
Shambler Rescuer,"The sea is vast and full of hazards, some natural and others not so much.
Shipwrecks are relatively common, and often spell death for the crew members
who manage to stay afloat after the ship has sunk. All is lost for them... unless
it is their lucky day, and a bony hand emerges from the ocean to bring them to
safety. There are many stories and legends about these mysterious creatures
who never utter a word... if they can speak at all. They do not expect anything
in return nor do they communicate in any way with the people they save; they
simply appear when they are needed most, saving victims of shipwrecks or
guiding wandering ships that had lost their way. Some say they come from the
world of the Plague Doctors, others think this is a species who suffered the
same fate as the Shambler Rescuers. When James landed on Rodia, he
brought some of these creatures with him, but his crew never mentioned
seeing them in any of the Revenant engravings.
"
Shapeshifter Novice,"The malleable structure of Shapeshifters allows them to take on the
appearance and physiological functioning of other species. These creatures
must first learn certain principles about transformation and taxonomy.

An Apprentice has not mastered these principles yet, and its transformations
are incomplete or unsuitable, sometimes even spontaneous. Their abilities are
affected by the lunar phases, especially by the full moon, which causes
involuntary transformations while they sleep.
"
Shogun,"Not all humans tried to enslave Brownies at the same time in all regions of the
world, but it happened everywhere due to the ambitious nature of the former.
Unfortunately, the Brownie rebellion did not prosper in some parts of the world.
Shoguns come from such countries, places far beyond the seas where only the
strongest can be free. However, many have grown tired of living as fugitives
and have migrated to other regions in search of a new life.
"
Siege Automaton,"A pitched battle between two mafias devastated Irizen, a town in Andolin. By
the time the authorities arrived in what was left of it, they found only the
criminals’ bodies and hundreds of civilian casualties.

A group of Skeletons managed to get ahold of the Automaton blueprints and
built Siege Automatons to assist them in their skirmishes. Their shots can go
through walls even at long distances if they are charged for a minute before

firing. In addition, they can release highly pressurized air that allows them to
jump very high if they aim their cannons at the ground.
"
Siege Clockwork,"Clockworks make sure that everything in Damarel works properly. Each one
has its role, and they only act based on contingencies that are rarely too
complex.

Alexandria built the Siege Clockwork for the purpose of transporting material
from one place to another through the intricate maze of rails that runs through
the cogs of Damarel. Nowadays, with the arrival of outsiders, these creatures
also transport other Clockworks so they can face any threat as quickly as
possible.
"
Silent Hunter,"Due to unknown circumstances, some groups of Hunters become evil and
travel Rodia while committing misdeeds. At the head of such groups there is
always a Silent Hunter, an individual that carries no religious item, which leads
scholars of non-human sacieties to believe they do not profess any faith. They
are extremely cruel and bloodthirsty, and often plunder small villages and
towns at night, stealing everything they can carry and murdering the inhabitants
in cold blood.
"
Silver Imler,"In their societies, Imlers work as miners and diggers. Along with the Imlings,
they establish their settlements in mountainous regions. The bonds between
them are strong, forged from a very young age, and it is rare to see an Imler
without an Imling partner.

The protuberances in the Silver Imler's shoulders sell at a high price in the
black market. Their Imling partners try to convince them to remove them so
that they are no longer a target for poachers.
"
Silverbone Construct,"At present, some Constructs serve as labor for the heavier jobs such as
construction or mining. When the war against an old ruler of Siralim came to an
end, they became important assets in the reconstruction of the country.

When a Silverbone Construct meets an enemy, the eyes on its armor's skulls
shine with a ghostly blue flame. An eerie voice then emanates from within,
whispering continuously, until it suddenly explodes into a bloodcurdling scream.
This feature was added for frightening enemies, but in the end, it mainly served
as an alarm during attacks, and to scare civilians so they got to safety more
quickly.
"
Silverclaw Griffon,"In every flock of Griffons there are keen individuals with natural talent for battle.
These birds have a greater chance of reproducing and are always considered
leaders within their flock. When faced with an enemy threat or the need to
attack, they lead the charge and let the other Griffons know the strategy
through a wide range of calls.
"
Singerbread Man,"These creatures are not really made of gingerbread. If so, any blow could
cause them to crumble and it would be impossible for them to enter battle.
They are intelligent and inhabit a forest southeast of Undolim. They are
excellent bakers, and there are actually several cooking schools throughout
Rodia where these creatures teach. Gingerbread cookies in the shape of men,
typical in Rodia, were first baked when a student made some for his
Singerbread Man teacher, baking them in its own appearance.
"
Siralim Seraph,"Helmholtz and Milner, two Magi of legend, had the idea of uniting every
kingdom into one country to stop the impending catastrophe. After long talks
were had and deals struck, six kingdoms acceded, but the rest rebelled after
their refusal.

The Siralim Seraph's blade represents courage, a flame that no storm can
extinguish. It leaves a trail of fire that fills people's hearts with bravery. If its
allies are in danger, it channels every last drop of its energy into a barrier that
few can pierce.
"
Siren Ascendant,"The songs of the Sirens are well known by the sailors and pirates who sail the
seas. It begins as a distant, soft, almost ethereal murmur, but as one listens
more closely, the voice becomes irresistible and it is too late to turn back.

The Siren Ascendant is a creature of incredible power who uses its eye of
providence to effortlessly curse its enemies. If the eye is destroyed or removed
by force, it regenerates after a few days.
"
Siren Beguiler,"Sirens do not always sing with the intention of harming others. However, many
of them inhabit the oceans, and make their homes near rocky elevations where
a ship could easily run aground.

The song of the Siren Beguiler evokes the feeling that great riches can be
found in the direction of the sound. Many sailors have learned to distinguish the
song, and they fire the cannons of their ships when they hear it to scare the
creatures away.
"
Siren Coercer,"Sirens were once peaceful beings who over the years witnessed the atrocities
of humans and other intelligent creatures. Today, many of them feel the need
to punish mortals.

The Siren Coercer has learned much from other intelligent beings and knows
how to wield their weapons and tools. At night, it sneaks into the cabins of the
ships and murders the sleeping sailors one by one, plunging its knife into their
chest.
"
Siren Lifetaker,"The Siren Lifetaker was once a Coercer who, after decades of living in this
world, decided to get serious. It only acts at night and it moves stealthily,
avoiding being seen by crowds. It is observant and cautious, and only begins to
sing when it knows it has the advantage over its victims. Its song, perfected for
years, is much more effective than that of the other Sirens. When its audience
approaches, it glides gracefully and lets the edge of its scythe slice each neck.
"
Siren Oracle,"Many Sirens have the ability to charm weak-willed creatures with their songs to
make them obey their commands.

The Siren Oracle has a crystal sphere with which it can supposedly see visions
of the future. Many of them use it to manipulate people who have chosen dark
paths, revealing disastrous events that will unfold if they continue on that path.
"
Siren Purifier,"Siren Purifiers can smell evil miles away, but their senses have atrophied
because of the sheer number of stimuli they receive constantly. They are
unable to differentiate between true villainy and simple selfish actions without
importance. These creatures can summon blue fire in the palm of their hands
that makes any creature hit by it fall asleep. This is especially dangerous for
ships at night, as the Siren Purifier often targets the helmsperson and causes
the entire crew to lose their way.
"
Siren Soothsayer,"No mortal knows for certain how the Siren Soothsayers came to be. Some
believe they were born from the laughter of Lister. Others, that they were
created by Tartarith to torment humans. When the gem on their forehead
begins to glow, every creature around them receives visions of horrible events,
and an unquestionable certainty that they will come to pass in the future.
However, this only happens in battle. Some testimonies state that the glow
produces hopeful images in other situations.
"
Skelegoop,"Fifteen hundred years ago, there was a war between two kingdoms—the
humans and other creatures of Ercath against the Solomons of Pherior, a
species of hominid rhinoceros that only inhabited that land. This species
believed all kingdoms had to abide by their laws, and they never surrendered,
even when not a single warrior was left alive. A necromancer Solomon who
had studied magic in Siralim managed to revive some of his own kind by
creating the Skelegoop. They say the purple, goo-looking glow surrounding its
body is the will of the Solomon to enforce their laws. At present, this species
has advanced, and it seems like it is no longer interested in imposing its laws,
although they remain very strict in their own kingdom, so Ercath, Rodia, and
other nations are paying attention to their movements just in case.
"
Skeleton Buccaneer,"William James was a famous pirate captain on the other side of the ocean; but
after being afflicted with a curse, he left for distant lands with all his fleet,
searching for the Mercury Cross, a legendary item able to put an end ta it.
Now, he and his crew are trying to amass a large enough fortune to rebuild the
ships they lost and sail anew. His favorite technique is to use his grappling
hook to pull his opponents closer and shoot them, kicking the lifeless body
when it is close enough.
"
Skeleton Cannoneer,"This small-time outlaw specializes in raiding caravans. It stays hidden behind
the bushes and shoots at the wheels to damage them with its powerful
weapon. It then lets its teammates do the dirty work, though if it looks like they
are at a disadvantage it will attack the enemies, pulverizing limbs and armor
with a single shot.
"
Skeleton Gunslinger,"With its face hidden behind a bandana and its hat leaning forward, the Skeleton
Gunslinger is able to sneak into a city unnoticed, even when it is under heavy
guard. It looks for strong opponents worthy of using its rifles and challenges
them to a duel in the middle of the road, and it usually wins. When it needs
money, it usually robs large mansions, city halls, or any building that looks
profitable enough.
"
Skeleton Marksman,"Able to take on large groups on its own, the Skeleton Marksman walks in a
slow and cocky way towards its opponents, shooting ruthlessly in all directions.
When that is not enough to make them flee in disarray, it will skillfully slip
among any enemies that manage to approach, causing serious injuries with
well-aimed shots of its firearms. If there are survivors, it will tie them to a horse
and drag them down the road until they die.
"
Skeleton Mortarman,"The Skeletons used to be pirates in unknown waters some time ago, but now
they have no choice but to wander Rodia, committing all kinds of misdeeds.
The spread of this creature's weapon allows it to hit several enemies at once if
they are close to each other. The Skeletons that travel with it often keep an eye
on their belongings, as it has been known to steal coins and use them as
bullets once it runs out of ammunition.
"
Skeleton Sniper,"These individuals arrived in Rodia not long ago, in a large fleet of ships that
was stranded on the coast after a heavy storm. They come from a very distant
and completely unknown land, and their body is devoid of flesh and organs due
to a curse they received on an island full of ancient treasures. They usually
attack from a distance with technology that does not exist in this country, and
though the shots of the Skeleton Sniper are not exactly deadly, they do have a
long range.
"
Skeleton Triggerman,"The Skeleton Triggerman is the most swashbuckling of its kind. It likes to sneak
into big cities, go into taverns of lesser repute and shoot up the place for fun.
Thanks to its reckless behavior, the main weakness of its species was quickly
discovered: the only way to defeat them for good is to damage their skulls. It
also seems to like drinking whiskey, though it spills on the floor through the
cavity of its throat.
"
Skull Devil,"The Skull Devil can make flowers wither or slowly extinguish a person's life. But
it does not always have such patience. Skull Devils need to reap at least one
life every day or they become dust, but, as they are banned from all the cities in
Rodia, they wait in areas where merchant caravans usually camp for the night.
When a group of travelers arrives, the Devil comes out of the shadows and
uses its scythe to cut off the head of any traveler who wanders off from the
group.
"
Sky Watcher,"Many of Surathli's faithful, rejoicing at these creatures’ arrival, invited them into
the temples erected in her name. Days later, the Goddess of Light watched the
slaughter helplessly, pitying the mortals who had trusted the Watchers. The
battle seemed lost, for no human or creature was able to stop the Watchers’
advance.
"
Skyward Vulpes,"Originally from the snowy regions of Rodia, Skyward Vulpes quickly became
famous for the cold emanating from their bodies. Indeed, some experienced
Magi have begun to hunt and sell them to the wealthiest people in the country
as an ostentatious method of food preservation, and to cool their homes during
the warm season. They are usually locked up in cages, which are then placed
in the pantries of these morally bankrupt individuals.
"
Skywatch Construct,"The temple of Surathli in the city of Nex already has several of these creatures,
which act as sacristans while giving the Goddess's house a more ceremonious
appearance. Undoubtedly, however, its most significant contribution is guarding
the borders of cities and towns, as they are very efficient in the detection and
hunting of Harpies. Recently, the ruler of Nex asked the Council of Sovereigns
to increase the production of these Constructs specifically for this purpose.
"
Sludgechemist,"Venedon originally thought that Concactions had no conscience. However, he
discovered some time later that many of them grouped together and changed
shape in front of each other, as if trying to communicate.

The Sludgechemist always carries a flask into which it pours part of its own
substance. It is somehow able to change the nature of that piece of itself,
producing different effects. To date, they are known to be able to make liquid
soap, raspberry jelly and a hot sauce unsuited to beginners.
"
Slurping Bat,"The Slurping Bat used to be just a bogeyman to scare children into good
behavior. Now it is a whirlwind of hate and violence towards authority, because
one those children became a powerful Mage who, after years of research,
succeeded in giving shape to this nightmare to get revenge on her abusive
parents.
"
Smog Lord,"Some agricultural companies hire mercenaries to capture Smogs and drop
them in the fields of the competition. These practices are punished by law,
which is why other companies pretend to have suffered an attack in order to
falsely accuse their rivals.

Smog Lords are an exception among their kind, as they do not target the
common people of Radia. They used to be workers who were not prisoners of
war, so they direct their attacks toward the universities of magic and the
leaders of each kingdom.
"
Smoke Devil,"The Smoke Devil emerged from the ashes after a war lost in time and is unable
to think. Since then it has traveled the world in silence with a lifeless gaze,
leaving behind a mysterious cloud of dust. Wherever it goes there is anger, a
fight, an argument, or maybe even a war, as if its very presence was the
embodiment of Chaos. Although it carries a sword, it never gets into trouble
and will only use it to defend itself.
"
Snaptrap Cultivar,"Snaptraps lived only on the island of Eferia, but James and his crew brought
with them a good number of seeds which they soon used to trade in Radia, as
they usually do.

A group of Rodian scientists crossed Snaptrap seeds with other local plants
and managed to create a hybrid between a Battrap and various fruit-bearing
shrubs. The so-called Snaptrap Cultivar feeds on insects and attacks larger
animals when they try to pluck their fruit before it is ripe. Their attacks can be
deadly, but once the fruit is ripe it drops on its own and the Cultivar Snaptrap
stops responding aggressively if someone tries to get ahold of it.
"
Snow Lily,"In the past, these creatures were harmless little furballs that preyed on insects.
Obviously, these insects would disagree with the previous sentence, but Snow
Lilies won the hearts of some species such as humans, especially in the
summer, when certain pests would ruin crops and bother people at night. Over
time they evolved and some were domesticated, although they were never
thought of as warriors to lead into battle. However, the Brownie Rebellion
changed their fate. Many of them, loyal to these creatures, supported and
fought alongside them tooth and nail, proving from that moment that they
should not be taken lightly.
"
Snowsting Yeti,"When the rest of the Yetis freeze an enemy, this creature utters a guttural roar
and charges with all its might in that direction. The spikes on its shoulders can
pierce and break ice no matter how thick it is, causing serious injuries that, in
the best of cases, leave the enemy unable to keep fighting. This is a useful skill
when foraging, as there are many creatures trapped in the ice of the Frostbite
Caverns that the Snowsting Yeti can easily extract.
"
Solar Amaranth,"Like the rest of the Amaranths, this creature only responds with violence when
it is in danger. By concentrating, it can summon fire from anywhere in the world
and use it against whoever is trying to harm it. Milner and Helmholtz, two
legendary Magi who managed to overcome death, have noticed how the
Amaranths have become more restless with the passage of centuries, and
sightings of them have increased. However, they have not yet found an
explanation for this mystery.
"
Sorcery Shapeshifter,"Long ago, the dark lord Sigmund kidnapped several of these creatures to
experiment on them and develop a famous prcject he called ""Genesis"".
However, his death prevented him from successfully completing it. Dealing with
humans awakens ambitious desires in many creatures.

The Sorcery Shapeshifter is a good example of this, almost unrecognizable
after having spent some time in human cities, learning the secrets of magic.
However, some manage to readjust and become great leaders of their tribe.
"
Soul Reaper,"Ainsworth and her team investigated the Reapers and discovered that
whenever one of them dies it automatically reappears in another part of the
world.

The Soul Reaper has a different task than the rest of its species. Sometimes,
for many reasons, the souls of mortals are trapped in our world. This creature
can literally sever the chains that bind them to this world and lead them to the
afterlife.
"
Soulflayer Depriver,"When Gloom managed to enter the realms of her five friends, she found a way
to let them communicate with each other, greatly easing the loneliness that had
invaded their hearts.

Soulflayer councils are made up of their wisest members, and generally have
several Overlords. If the issue at hand is complex and requires extra attention,
the Soulflayer Deprivers delay the need for these creatures to sleep so they
can solve it as soon as possible. Before a battle, Soulflayer Deprivers infiltrate
the enemy's ranks and prevent them from falling asleep so they are drowsy
and exhausted when they go to battle.
"
Soulflayer Dreamcaster,"Vyre and Sevalah, two siblings who promoted the church of Surathli in lands
threatened by creatures from the underworld, were recruited by the Auditors
after they noticed their great power, and worked for many years alongside four
other agents.

Soulflayers communicate through telepathy. As its name suggests, the
Soulflayer Dreamcaster can alter other creatures’ dreams, generally to
influence them so they distrust their family, colleagues or friends.
"
Soulflayer Drone,"Vyre, skilled with the blade, worked for the Auditors under the name of Dawn,
while Sevalah, a scholar of magic and a powerful sorceress, was known among
its members as Gloom.

Rodia's authorities consider the arrival of the Soulflayers a great threat, due to
their thirst for power which generally creates discord among the other species.

During a raid, the Soulflayer Drone flies over its target, casting spells left and
right in order to prevent the defender from noticing the true threat.
"
Soulflayer Overlord,"Gloom was the only agent in her group who did not ascend into godhoad, but
she challenged the Gods at their own game and managed to find a way to
access the realms of her friends without needing to break the Rod of Ruin.

Soulflayer Overlords are the leaders of their society, but their power is not
absolute, and their decisions are not indisputable. In their councils, their words
are heard and respected more than those of any other member, but the final
decision must always be made unanimously.
"
Soulflayer Peacemaker,"These five new realms were anchored to the Temple of Lies both so they could
be in balance and to avoid being discovered. This is why these five realms also
became accessible after the Rod of Ruin was broken.

All Soulflayers are experts in manipulation, but Soulflayer Peacemakers
specialize in conflict resolution. They generally calm their own kind's tempers
when an argument puts their interests in jeopardy, but they also use their
abilities to gain the trust of other species.
"
Soulflayer Prober,"To save the world from the cataclysm the Itherian Realms would cause, five of
the six agents in Dawn and Gloom's group became Gods and created five
realms that, in perfect balance and harmony, prevented these echoes from
pouring into reality.

Soulflayers are devious creatures who prefer to act in the shadows. Only when
this fails do they choose a different plan of action.

When a Soulflayer Prober touches a wound with its hand, the wound
disappears and stops causing pain for an hour, causing many individuals to
bleed to death without knowing why.
"
Spade Luckmantria,"Since the Luckmantrias arrived in Rodia, all kinds of rumors have arisen about
their luck-related powers. That is why the Rodians quickly discovered that trying
to chase them can be as dangerous as climbing to the top of a mountain during
a thunderstorm.

The wheat and corn fields of Hutika are infested with Spade Luckmantrias,
something the Uraloses are not precisely excited about. Though Luckmantrias
do not feel threatened by these beings, sometimes they could be injured by
accident, if it were not because someone forgot a harvesting instrument among
the branches that fortuitously ended up stamped on a Uralos snout.
"
Sparktail Courier,"Sparktails are native to the Great Lake of Blue Emerald, at the other end of the
continent where Rodia is located. However, they can also live on the surface
world and perform all kinds of jobs wherever they make their homes.

Sparktail Couriers can move at a brisk pace without resting until nightfall, which
allows them to travel long distances in a very short time. In addition, their tails
act as compasses, allowing them to orient themselves perfectly at all times.
"
Sparktail Engineer,"Sparktails are generally peaceful creatures, and when they reach maturity they
gain the ability to levitate by using powerful electromagnetism.

The smartest Sparktails can become anything they want, such as scientists,
engineers, or judges, but they are all commonly called Sparktail Engineers.
They can use the electricity in their tails in a very verstaile way which, for
example, allows them to weld metals, provoke chemical reactions or even
create an electric current to resuscitate an individual in cardiac arrest. These
creatures are very rare in Rodia. Most of them live in the countries in the north
of the continent, where magic is harder to develop and technology is much
more advanced, in part thanks to their contributions.
"
Sparktail Officer,"The tail of a Sparktail is charged with electricity. They use it as a weapon to
defend themselved if they are in trouble, but also for other tasks. For example,
Sparktail Officers can use it to shoot red and blue beams of electricity.
Although they only cause a slight tingling sensation, they can be used to signal
there is an emergency while moving through the air with a grim face.
"
Sparktail Professor,"When a Sparktail reaches maturity, they gain the ability to breathe out of water.
That is why many of these creatures have decided to leave Blue Emerald and
integrate into other societies.

Sparktail Professors are the cornerstone of their community. Even though they
can teach anywhere, their most vital task is to oversee the learning of the
children of their kind, as once they take the Step, there is no turning back. Even
when out of the water, the Professors’ tails allow them to move small objects
without touching them.
"
Sparktail Searcher,"The Great Lake of Blue Emerald is slightly smaller than the whole country of
Rodia. Sparktails have built an entire underwater civilization at the bottom of
the lake, with towns and cities spread across the bed.

Sparktail Searchers are extraordinary miners, as they can see in the dark
without any tools, but mostly because of their tails. They can use their tails to
drill holes in walls quickly and accurately, and also to discern the purity of
nearby minerals.
"
Sparktail Student,"Sparktails are an intelligent species that reaches maturity once a third of their
life cycle has passed. This moment is called the Step, an event that literally
changes them for the rest of their lives. Depending on their personality and
what they have learned, their entire structure changes to grant them various
abilities. Before the Step, their electricity is still weak and invisible, and does not
allow them to do anything special, so they are required to live at Blue Emerald
for their safety and learning.
"
Spectral Familiar,"She appeared at the top of the Cornell Tower after the events that led to the
activation of 10 Nether Orbs at once. Having foreseen the future of Rodia, the
Familiars performed an ancient ritual to channel some of the energy released
during this event into the skeleton of Washburn, the greatest Familiar who ever
lived, as well as into her soul, contained inside a powerful Nether Orb. She is
now more powerful than ever, and immortal. Her vote in the Council is worth
the same as any other, but her opinion is always decisive.
"
Sphinx Avenger,"Sphinxes arrived in the Kaito Empire after the first pyramids were built. They
presented themselves as divine, majestic creatures, and they knew how to use
magic better than anyone else. At the same time, Sphinxes learned some
things from humans.

The Sphinx Avenger watched the royal guard and learned how to use weapons
to avoid exposing its face and claws in hand-to-hand combat.
"
Sphinx Elder,"At first, the number of Sphinxes in the Empire was very small. However, with
the passage of generations, they began to arrive from other parts of the world,
producing fear and doubt in the sovereigns of Kaito.

When a Sphinx reaches one hundred years of age, it stops exposing itself in
battle. Instead it gives advice to its allies with its great wisdom and experience
and waits in the air for the opportunity to cast a powerful spell.
"
Sphinx Healer,"The people of Kaito venerated the Sphinxes and felt protected in their
presence. They usually made offerings to these creatures in the towns and
cities of the Empire, especially to Sphinx Healers. The sick and those unable to
walk visited the temples where these creatures lived and offered them great
gifts. In return, this creature uttered strange words and the orb it carried with it
emitted a dim light. The diseases disappeared and the injured could walk again.
"
Sphinx Justicar,"At a certain point, Sphinxes began to appear in the iconography of Kaito.
According to Pharaoh Kerufen, there were too many and it seemed like they
were everywhere. But the people adored them, and Kerufen had no choice but
to erect a monument in their honor.

Sphinx Justicars sacrifice their eyes to obtain visions of the future and intervene
when they deem it necessary. Their visions do not show events exactly as they
are going to happen, but they are close enough to be useful.
"
Sphinx Ordainer,"In the towns and cities of the Empire, the people of Kaito began to erect
temples in which to worship Sphinxes. This was apparently suggested by the
Sphinxes themselves. According to Queen-Pharach Hatesh, they rather built a
house in which to serve them food and grant their wishes. Most of these
requests were made by the Sphinx Ordainer, who, with carefully chosen words,
obtained what it wanted from humans without them suspecting that they were
being manipulated.
"
Sphinx Usurper,"The Sphinxes awakened the Mummies and used them to conquer the Kaito
Empire. This creature, along with the Swarm Mummy, burst into the throne
room and tore off the head of Ateppicmon, proclaiming itself the new Pharaoh.
Humans were forced into slavery by the Sphinxes, living in misery until the
Watchers arrived. When these creatures attacked the Empire, the humans did
not help the Sphinxes, instead fleeing far from the wastelands and leaving their
home to be consumed and fall into oblivion.
"
Sphinx Zealot,"The sovereigns of Kaito ordered their priests and priestesses to go to the towns
and cities and closely observe the Sphinxes to learn more about magic. That
brought great advances to their spells and rituals that culminated in a horrible
curse.

AA Sphinx Zealot befriended a priest of the Empire and instructed him in the art
of magic. It also convinced him that Sphinxes were superior creatures that
should rule the world to bring order and prosperity.
"
Spider Occultist,"Hundreds of Nether Orbs were taken to the Refuge of the Magi during this
time. Some barely contained any power, but others could allow a mortal to
ascend to a state of divinity.

Occulltists seem to be insane and sometimes turn on the same person they
wanted to help and attack without warning. Washburn noted this fact when the
Spider Occultist she had been working with for fifty years suddenly decided to
attack her tower with magic missiles.
"
Spirit Vulpes,"This creature appeared recently in Rodia and, though it rarely approaches
towns and cities, it did not take long before myths and legends sprang up
around it. Although it certainly cannot steal human souls with its eyes, it does
enjoy chasing unlucky travelers, wha flee in terror when they encounter it.
"
Spirits,"Aware of the damage the Blue Bloods could cause to the world, the Auditors
decided to exterminate them for the greater good.

Many rumors about the properties of the Alementals have appeared in the
short time since their creation. Most people believe a touch is enough for them
to spread their inebriation, while others think they are an inexhaustible supply of
beer. Because of this, there have been attempts to kidnap these creatures,
some of which have been successful.

Spirits is a calm and quiet creature, but it does not tolerate excesses. When it
sees someone getting too drunk, it has no qualms about entering their body
until they pass out.
"
Spitting Arachnalisk,"The children of Regalis mainly inhabit the Arachnid Nest, but they have spread
through Rodia and have an ecological niche in mast of the country's
ecosystems.

Spitting Arachnalisks sometimes compete for territory with each other, through
a very particular confrontation. Each contender builds a web in the shape of a
target approximately 10 meters away from its rival, and they take turns to spit
acid on each other's webs until one of them falls.
"
Spitting Basilisk,"Although Basilisks are much larger than humans, they have learned not to pick
a fight with them. Still, showing fear in front of these creatures often means
becoming their prey.

According to a legend, the Spitting Basilisk is a rare specimen that, in addition
to emitting a powerful scream, releases a substance that causes death on
contact with the skin. This, like many other legends, is false. Its saliva, in fact,
has powerful healing and analgesic properties.
"
Spitting Pit Worm,"Pit Worms are typically between six and ten feet in length. For some reason,
most of them live far from population centers and trade routes. There are two
theories in this regard: either intelligent creatures built their settlements based
on the number of attacks by these creatures, or the Pit Worms somehow
learned that the inhabitants of the surface are usually more dangerous than
them.

The Spitting Pit Worm's saliva goes directly to the bloodstream, causing
nausea and intestinal irritation.
"
Spooky Shade,"Spooky Shades are born from the death of spies. Their instincts drive them to
hide their identity by masking their appearance, which works as well as can be
expected from a Shade. However, since these creatures can briefly put images
of anything they've seen into the mind of another, many spies that work for
sovereigns or crime syndicates continue doing so after death.
"
Springtime Aspect,"The Springtime Aspect emerges from the hills when they are covered in
flowers, rising heavily and shaking the dirt from its mossy fur. Its body is home
to insects and small birds, and bees often visit the flowers that grow on its arms
and head. Its very presence helps the flowers bloom in the most arid regions
and its cane punishes those who exploit the land.
"
Spry Satyr,"Before creating the Blood Grove, Apocranox assembled a group of humans to
establish a colony in his realm. After drinking from the springs and eating the
fruits that grew there, these humans became Satyrs.

Due to Eft attacks, many Satyrs suffer serious injuries. Losing a limb is not
uncommon in the Blood Grove, but unlike Inquisitors, Satyrs cannot
regenerate. This does not stop these Satyrs from entering battle, adapting their
combat form so it continues to be effective.
"
Squash,"There are numerous stories about lucky items and animals, and enough proof
to know most of them are just stories. However, the Squash is an exception to
the rule. Like most Dumplings, these creatures are very elusive. However,
those who obtain one are undoubtedly blessed with good luck. It is as if the
universe conspired so that everything that happens around this creature ends
well for those nearby, which has led to terrible stories about the consequences
of eating a Squash, as well as explanations from more skeptical people who
think the Squash simply affects the world around it with some sort of magic.
"
Stag Abstract,"This creature appears with a snap, curving space around it. The Stag Abstract
does not walk, it is simply in one place and then instantly in another. Its attacks
are devastating, as predicting its movements is virtually impossible. There is a
rumor that this creature's antlers allow travel between worlds, but it is more
likely that whoever confronts it will only get a one-way ticket to the afterlife.
"
Stag Celestial,"The activation of ten Nether Orbs at once transformed part of Rodia's fauna,
granting it magical powers.

The Stag Celestial is a good example of this phenomenon: its former predators
are now its prey, which has significantly altered its ecosystem. Now, they roam
freely around the country, attacking anything even vaguely related to magic.
"
Stag Guardian,"Stag Guardians used to live in closed forests before undergoing their
transformation, after which many of them dispersed. They earned their name
by keeping threats to their home at bay, from natural disasters to enemy
creatures that want to take advantage of the forest's resources. They have
been seen cooperating with Moss Golems and Ents to face especially
dangerous threats.
"
Stag Guide,"The Stag Guide is one of the rarest specimens of its kind, and capturing one is
almost impossible due to its ability to travel through time. Their horns were
believed to be the source of this power, but a scientist from Neralim recently
proved the rumors wrong. Despite this discovery, these creatures are still being
hunted by countless mercenaries, so they have become timider and less
aggressive.
"
Stag Idol,"Overnight, the Stag Idol has become one of the mast coveted trophies for
Rodia's hunters. Its golden antlers have won it fame, but it is not easy prey by
any means. Endowed with magical powers and an extraordinary strength, this
creature is capable of overpowering seasoned warriors with a headbutt that
sometimes even tears through their organs.
"
Stag Overseer,"The Stag Overseer is a monster of the night that terrorizes unfortunate
travelers. This creature likes to stand tall in the distance, forming a dark
silhouette against the full moon. When someone notices it, it disappears into
the shadows, moving silently while hiding from its victims. Until, suddenly, they
are lost in the dark, never to be seen again.
"
Stag Royal,"More than two meters high, and with an even longer space between its antlers,
the Stag Royal is the largest of its species. In recent times, they have become
quite an annoyance for Rodia's farmers, as they browse freely in their
vegetable gardens and, what is worse, they also eat their livestock. Many of
these farmers have begun to employ Magi to put an end to this terrible plague.
"
Stag Spirit,"When the fog rolls in at night, few villagers are foolhardy enough not to
barricade their doors and windows. Its footsteps make no sound; its breathing
has long stopped. The only thing you will see when it finds you is a pair of
bright eyes floating in the air, waiting just long enough for fear to take hold of
you before ending your life.
"
Stardust Amaranth,"Amaranths seem to be exempt from the laws of the universe, as their powers
are above them. When they move, it looks like space is moving around them
instead.

The Stardust Amaranth emits a constant tinkle and shines with a soft, subdued
light that illuminated everything around it. To attack physically, this creature
does not have to move or be in direct contact with its enemy. The blow simply
happens.
"
Static Clutcher,"It can be said that Taylor was the first human to create a creature, as Clutchers
were the first species not to be engendered by the Gods. The Static Clutcher
was his first great success, an obedient being who followed him everywhere
and inspired fear in his sutjects. He used it to punish those who did not follow
his orders to the letter. This creature would grab its victims' faces and emit a
painful discharge that burned their bodies and sometimes even killed them.
"
Steampowered Pilwiz,"Due to the extreme difference between the human and Pilwiz voice tracts, both
species jointly developed a simple sign language to allow communication
between them.

Harsh weather can sometimes prevent Pilwiz and other farmers from taking
care of their crops. Aware of this, the engineers of Nex designed an automaton
that can perform these activities in the extreme cold and the suffocating heat.
"
Steelheart Gargoyle,"This creature is not really a Gargoyle, but an automaton that responds to the
Auditors’ orders. The barrier that protects the city of Ubi Concordia also hides it
from view and magical scrying, although an extremely powerful Mage could
bypass all these protections. If an intruder were to enter the city, the Steelheart
Gargoyle would take flight and plummet on its target, spinning like a whirlwind
to rip them apart with the edge of its pointed wings.
"
Sticky Snaptrap,"One of the most spectacular shows in the world occurs during the night in
Eferia, when Snaptraps expel part of the residual energy of the creatures they
have devoured. That is, when they expel their ""memories"".

Fights between Snaptraps take place from time to time, usually because of a
dispute over prey, but they are rarely fatal for any of the opponents.

The Sticky Snaptrap uses the suckers on its branches to stick to tree trunks
and surprise its prey from unexpected angles. Usually, it does not move from
the trunk and uses its sticky branches to catch very small animals and bring
them to its mouth, but if larger prey passes under it, it drops and coils to devour
it.
"
Stillfire Gemling,"It is believed that Carbuncles pass on their memories from one generation to
the next through the gems on their foreheads. If this is the case, Gemlings also
have those memories, as they were created by using the gems of several
Carbuncles, the descendants of those who failed to escape thousands of years
ago.

Stillfire Gemlings are the most dangerous of their kind, since their bodies can
produce enough heat to burn wood in a matter of minutes. Because of this,
more than a dozen floors of the Refuge of the Magi were permanently closed
after being consumed by the flames.
"
Stomping Basilisk,"Basilisks are usually between six and seven feet in length, and feed on all kinds
of creatures or carrion. These creatures do not take risks when they are alone,
and generally avoid attacking creatures their own size.

Out of all the Basilisks, there is only one that does not scream in battle.
Instead, it makes an inhaling sound that, after a few seconds, ends up
absorbing all the magic around it.
"
Stone Devil,"The Stone Devil usually roams around the periphery of the woods, looking for
innocent campers who just want to relax in nature. It will appear to be a
good-natured satyr and tell anyone it finds that it knows of a beautiful place
near the forest entrance where they could go spend the afternoon. Once it
guides them there, it will wait until they make a ""mistake"". A broken branch, a
flower stepped on by accident. Any excuse will do to bludgeon them to death
with its heavy mace.
"
Stone Giant,"Its rocky body is a double-edged sword, as, unlike the Sand Giant, it is unable
to regenerate. However, its destructive power is equivalent to a modern siege
weapon, though the Stone Giant is a siege weapon in and of itself. They craft
the stone clubs they carry with their own hands, by punching the mountain
walls where the hardest minerals can be found.
"
Stonehorn Gargoyle,"At some point in history, a small number of Gargoyles became self-aware.
According to Marette, the ones with the mast intricate patterns of action may
have developed a personality based on said patterns. The Stonehorn Gargoyle
has led this small group for centuries, watching over Undolim at night from the
top of the cathedral. When the city was invaded by an old ruler of Siralim, the
Stonehorn Gargoyle was defeated and had no choice but to flee.
"
Storm Lord,"The angrier a Storm gets, the greater the electrical current that runs through its
body. However, the Storm Lord is always overflowing with electricity regardless
of its emotional state, and it occasionally emits spontaneous discharges that
can kill an animal or a child. On the other hand, the fact that it cannot produce
water like the rest of its species is extremely aggravating to it, so it often insults
the inferior power of the other Storms’ discharges.
"
Stronghold,"Whenever a town is razed by magic, it is common for the stones that used to
form its walls to join together, giving shape to these sinister-looking creatures
that only want to shelter anyone who needs it. Provided they're not a Mage,
that is.
"
Sturdy Gargantuan,"Gargantuans are generally placid and peaceful, though they are fond of
parsimoniously insulting any travelers they encounter. If one has had a bad
day, it may even throw a ""little"" dirt on them.

When a Sturdy Gargantuan is hit by a weapon, it begins to crack, but the earth
and rock that make up its body do not come off immediately. In this way, it is
possible for an enemy to be intimidated by the hardness of its body and flee a
battle that could have been won.
"
Styx Banshee,"The Path of the Damned was once known as Arcadia, a sunny green paradise
ruled by the Goddess of Peace. The Banshees, who emerged from remains of
the previous God of Darkness, were the first to populate the realm after it was
invaded by darkness and death.

Although they cannot speak or think like intelligent beings, Banshees can
establish bonds with other creatures. The screams of a Styx Banshee interfere
with their enemies’ spellcasting.
"
Subaqueous Dragon,"This creature is as old as the world and its origin is a mystery. It rules over the
sea-dwelling Dragons that never come to the surface, although there is an
ancient orb capable of summoning it and its armies if the cause is worthy of its
presence. Some historians fear that eventually rulers of Siralim, who often
interact with Nether Orbs, will corrupt the one that would summon this terrible
creature, and add it to Siralim's hosts.
"
Subversive Voidlord,"Given Dragan's impeccable track record, it was a shock that Laglor, his last
prcject, failed miserably. However, yet more enigmatic was what occurred
afterwards, when he disappeared from the tower, and apparently from the
whole world.

There is a limit to how many creatures a Voidlord can erase daily. This number
is usually three, though it is believed to depend on the victim's size.

The Subversive Voidlord can compress its body to appear much smaller. It
waits until it is surrounded, and when it is satisfied with the number of
attackers, it unfolds its tentacles, rising like a terrifying monster. The less
experienced fighters watch helplessly as the whirlwind of limbs oscillates in an
unpredictable and frightful way, unable to defend themselves as a tentacle
pierces their bodies.
"
Succubus Spirit,"In the past, there was a group who worshipped Sins, different from the Sin cult.
They performed songs and dances, magical rites that turned into lustful
practices. One day, at the height of their ecstasy, the Succubus Spirit
appeared. They watched the result of their worship with admiration and made it
their new god. With time, the songs and dances stopped, and the ceremonies
lost their true essence. Little by little, they abandoned their lives and became
shadows of what they once were.
"
Sulfuric Vortex,"Every Vortex is powered by pure magic and needs to consume at least one
Spell Gem every three days to keep its structure intact.

Sulfuric Vortices are made up of a corrosive magical substance that produces
first-degree burns in just a moment of contact with the skin. This property gets
stronger the smaller they are, and they can easily pierce their enemies"" bodies
at high speed when they are at their smallest size.
"
Summer Aspect,"When the summer sun warms the rivers and lakes of Radia, a hand, covered in
algae, emerges from the water and falls heavily on the shore to help the
Summer Aspect rise to the surface. People already used to this event tend to
ignore the creatures, but children usually flee in terror when they see them
while their parents laugh in the background. They are known to summon a
breeze that relieves the heat of the most suffocating summer days.
"
Sun Crusader,"When this creature's mace hits the body of its enemies, the sphere of light on
its head shines strongly. Because of this, it was believed that the Sun Crusader
gained power from fighting evil. However, the truth is that they do so by letting
their mace gain kinetic energy. Unfortunately, many innocents were judged
while this was still popular belief, and they lost their lives when the face of this
creature lit up.
"
Sunclaw Gargoyle,"Gargoyles are not self-aware. They are simply guided by certain instructions
that are determined during the process of their creation. However, the people of
Undolim have always just considered them to be reserved creatures.

During the day, Sunclaw Gargoyles fly high for hours to absorb solar energy. In
this way, they generate an aura of light that allows their allies to navigate even
the deepest darkness.
"
Superbia Sin,"Sins take shape when the selfish desires of humans and other intelligent
creatures have serious consequences. These creatures are not aggressive
unless attacked, but their disturbing presence simply cannot be ignored.

On one occasion, a famous theater actor had his performance interrupted
when a Superbia Sin entered the stage. Furious and utterly embarrassed, he
grabbed a mountain of props and threw it at the creature. Impassively, the Sin
responded by covering him in (real) fire and lava.
"
Supreme Administrator,"This creature is not really a Demigod, although it is programmed to speak like
them. To protect Ubi Concordia, a utopic city the Auditors built near the North
Pole, thousands of robots were built with the sole purpose of exterminating
anyone who managed to overcome the magical barrier Dragan and other Magi
had erected around the city. To date, these robots have never had to execute
their only order, but copies of them have slipped through the Itherian Realms,
making it possible to see these creatures elsewhere.
"
Surathli,"The Goddess of Light detests war and its terrible effects. Throughout history
she has tried to stop numerous conflicts that threatened the world. At present,
she regrets having helped a ruler of Siralim rise against Rodia and the Gods
themselves. Surathli understands that it was her greed for Emblems and that of
the other Gods that gave this person so much power. When the Gods
gathered, Surathli declared that from then on, they would only accept the
Emblems that had fallen in their own realms.
"
Surya Cherub,"While most Cherubs have resided within the Azure Dream since ancient times,
they have been known to occasionally vanish without explanation, never to
return. In recent times however these disappearances have accelerated to the
point that the sight of a Cherub within the Azure Dream is now an incredibly
rare sight. Within the Church of Surathli and the Cult of Yseros, this is widely
considered a very bad omen.

Wreathed in flames, the Surya Cherub radiates such intense heat that it is
tremendously dangerous to approach. Many Magi have inadvertently met an
unfortunate scorched end by the mere act of trying to summon and control one
of these creatures, without the Cherub making a single hostile action at all or
seemingly even being aware of what its presence is causing.
"
Suzaku,"Suzakus are majestic birds that have flown over the Great Pandemonium since
the dawn of civilization. They can withstand extremely high temperatures, even
those of lava, and they detest the cold to the point of spitting fire left and right in
order to heat up the environment. When one of these creatures thinks it has a
parasite, it dives into the magma to immediately end the parasite's life.
Vulcanar often points at these creatures while they are taking a bath to try to
convince someone to jump into the molten rock with them.
"
Swarm Mummy,"A priest learned from the Sphinxes more than any other. Along with one of
them, he developed a curse that he incautiously shared with others. Soon his
betrayal was discovered. He was mummified alive and hit with his own curse.
Then the Sphinxes made their move. They knew that humans were spying on
them and showed them just enough magic to create the mummies, which they
awoke to sow chaos. The Swarm Mummy brought terrible hardship to Kaito
and served the Sphinxes in their conquest of the Empire.
"
Swordslime,"Concoctions can assume any form, although mast of them have a preference.
However, they usually just look like shapeless masses that leave trails of
radioactive waste in their path.

The Swordslime is the only Concoction who chooses relatively humanoid
forms, if humans and other intelligent bipedal creatures will pardon the
expression. It often lies on the floor and pretends to be a fallen warrior with a
sword stuck in the chest, but when its victim turns around, the Swordslime
stands up, ready to strike them down in a single backstabbing blow. Quite a
cowardly creature.
"
T'mere M'rgo,"This God spends most of his time giving life to creatures in his realm. However,
none of them are really original, as their bodies are made up of parts from
different beings—the reason why he calls himself the Gad of Fusion. Although
many of these creatures have terrifying forms, none are especially dangerous
for a well-prepared adventurer. It was not until the Amalgam Gardens were
invaded by malicious outsiders that T'mere decided to give life to truly
dangerous creatures with the sole purpose of protecting his creations.
"
Tainted Imling,"Imlings are extremely fragile creatures who can barely lift any weight and often
contract diseases. Imlers feel a strong need to watch over them for this reason,
and the Imlings greatly appreciate it.

The Tainted Imling's cells were severely altered by magic during its
development. Its smell is intense and unpleasant, and its fluids are corrosive to
most creatures. In addition, its structure is so fragile that a strong magic shock
can suddenly alter it and turn this creature into an Imler.
"
Tanukrook,"There are stories in the towns around the forests of Undolim about a creature
that feeds on naughty children. Long ago, a rebellious little girl decided to put
an end to that old wives' tale by entering the forest with her friends. At nightfall,
she led them down a path among the trees, waited for them to get lost and hid
herself. She would end the stories, yes, but why not give them a good scare
first? Her friends, frightened, began to call her in increasingly loud voices.
When they were just about to panic, the girl dropped from a tree and roared as
if she were a ferocious beast. Her friends turned around, but their reaction was
not what she expected. They looked pale and were paralyzed by fear, looking
in the girl's direction but not at her. Her heart sank as she slowly turned around
and met the ghostly eyes of the Tanukrook.
"
Tartarith,"When Taylor's father arrived in the city, he was immediately arrested and taken
to the Torture Chamber. His son had fun with him for hours, peeling off his skin,
burning his face, pouring saltwater over him. Tartarith died in great pain and
guilt. Then, the Nether Orbs that Taylor had set as per Vertraag's advice
unleashed its power over his father. Tartarith breathed once more, but he was
completely insane. Turned into a merciless God, he approached his son and
said: | WILL NOT BE KILLED. NOW I KILL.
"
Tech Reaper,"This creature is not really a Reaper, but an automaton created to eliminate
anyone who enters the city of Ubi Concordia without the Auditors’ permission. It
handles its scythe formidably, and it does not need to hold it at all to strike with
it. Trying to snatch its weapon away is a mistake, as the scythe can deliver a
powerful electric shock if it is being held by anyone other than its owner.
"
Temperantias Sanctus,"Seven creatures emerged from the steam that came out of the Nether Orbs
before they were consumed. For a few moments, Spielrein and Baker admired
the solemn creatures, completely satisfied with their work.

The Temperantias Sanctus punishes those who consume more food than
necessary by releasing a blue powder that is irresistible to gluttons. The more
they eat, the greater their appetite becomes, creating a never-ending spiral that
ends in their deaths.
"
Tenbran,"Perdition created this creature at a time when he sorely missed his beloved
sister. Without intending it, Tenbran reflects in its face the state of mind in
which the God of Limbo is at that moment. They became very good friends and
debated on countless topics over the years. Upon the arrival of his sister
Sevalah, she looked at the creature with a raised eyebrow. ""I see you have
missed me, little brother,"" she said. Perdition smiled and hugged her tightly
while Tenbran watched the scene with its face filled with a sorrow not its own.
"
Tenebris,"River was a powerful Magi who studied in the Refuge of the Magi. There, he
formed a great friendship with another student named Hexilo. After a few years,
his friend began to develop an affinity for the dark arts, and later, when River
left the Refuge of the Magi, he began to hear stories of a necromancer who
terrorized a kingdom near Siralim, beyond the lands that would be known as
Rodia a few centuries later. Convinced it was his old friend, River traveled to
that kingdom and found that he was right. For several years they fought each
other until both of them joined the Auditors. Together with four other agents
they formed the Enclave of Six, and River led the group. The six Magi carried
out many missions throughout the world. Following the incident in the Refuge
of the Magi, River transformed into Tenebris. He soon found that using divine
power was not much different from using magic, something that neither
Apocranox nor Venedon had done up to that very moment. Using each other's
power he helped them create their own realms. He later created the Bastion of
the Void together with Mortem, and, after saying goodbye to his friends, he left
this world.
"
Terra Vulpes,"In exchange for losing their eyesight, Terra Vulpes can sense their environment
through the auras that surround all otjects and living things. When they are
hungry, they focus this sixth sense in a small area to detect sources of magic
they can feed on. These creatures were native to the deep forests of Rodia, but
after the events that led to the ascension of an old ruler of Siralim, they can
now be found near towns and cities.
"
Terror Hound,"Hound communication is a subtle, but infallible system. They use sound, the
location of the rest of the pack, and the movement of their prey to know exactly
what to do at any given time.

A Mage carried out a prcject in the basements of the Refuge of the Magi,
focusing on the mystical union that makes these creatures so dangerous. After
many years, he created the Terror Hound, a being who can merge with its pack
in very specific circumstances, giving a literal meaning to the expression that
best defines them: we are all one.
"
Terror Wight,"The passage of years and its new body have not taken its skill with the sword.
In fact, its undeath has allowed it to develop some skills. It uses its cunning
tongue to deceive creatures less intelligent than it by promising fame and
riches. When it dies, it plunges its blade into their lifeless bodies to absorb their
soul for the purpose of gaining more power.
"
Thana,"The Goddess of Earth has multiple ‘granddaughters’ shaped from the stone
and dirt and given life, who assist her in maintaining the balance within the
Forbidden Depths. Though there are only nine, among them Thana is a living
legend due to having found a way to bypass the seal on the Forbidden Depths,
and has been known to appear in Vulcanar's realm from time to time, causing
havoc in the fire god's domain.

There are records in the distant past of Thana even visiting the surface once for
a brief time; but as they cannot speak any of the Radian languages, the people
assumed Thana to be a terrible monster and attacked them. Thana retreated to
the Forbidden Depths badly injured and harboring a deep, violent hatred of
humanity that, thus far, they have not acted upon. This is of great concern to
Anneltha, who only entrusts Thana to those who she feels may grant them
more hopeful perspectives.
"
The Bearon,"There is a forest near the northern edge of the Bronze Sea where a most
unusual species of bears lives. They are intelligent, although they do not
communicate with words but with gestures and grunts. Most live in cozy
wooden houses and wear monacles and hats. When a house is left uninhabited
for a while, they reuse its wood to build again. Although they never leave the
forest in which they live, they have several clearings to which they go twice a
week to trade goods with outsiders and other Bearons.
"
The Dervish,"According to legend, there is a plain deep in the Unsullied Meadows, guarded
by creatures called Dervish. This is said to have been the first piece of land that
Aeolian shaped, or at least the first piece of land he was satisfied with. It is said
to be a very precious place for this God, and sometimes he even rests there.
Every time Aeolian lands on the cool grass of this plain, a hundred Dervish
each take shape from a blade of grass around him.
"
The First Spawn,"There are many species of lizards in the world, however, all of them come from
a single one that existed even before the Gods shaped the continents and
oceans. It is fast and elusive, able to blend into any environment. Although the
rest of its species evolved to become less dangerous when they adapted to
their environment, some of them remained in their original form due to the
extreme conditions that occur on the island of Bieiros, the only place in the
world in which the First Spawns can be found in the wild.
"
The Lost,"The Auditors are a group of unknown individuals who have been safeguarding
the stability of the world for centuries. Their existence is considered a myth,
and rumors suggest that their members have found the key to eternal life. The
organization's network of contacts is broad enough to have executors in every
continent, and though they usually are not formal members of the organization,
they are also granted the gift of eternal life on rare occasions. When the
Auditors decide to recruit an asset, and he or she refuses to appear before
them, The Lost takes action. This creature appears during the night to subdue
and gag the ""interested party” with its extraordinary strength. The Lost was
exiled centuries ago by its own kind, whose only habitat is on an island lost in
the depths of the Golden Sea.
"
Thinking Arbiter,"The substance that the Auditors inject into some creatures is harmless in life.
However, after death, these creatures"" souls will arrive at Ubi Concordia, where
they will enter a body the Auditors prepared for them, and act as Arbiters from
that moment on.

Thinking Arbiters carry out the most subtle tasks. They tend to stroll through big
cities, and are often seen both in the good and bad neighborhoods. Their
interventions are never too long, but their words can exert an influence capable
of unleashing all kinds of events, from a student strike to, perhaps in the future,
a coup d'état.
"
Thrasher Fiend,"Their terrifying, demon-like appearance, their tirelessness, and their voracious
hunger have given the Fiends a bad reputation. However, if they are trained
from a young age and fed pieces of meat instead of living creatures, they will
never devour their masters or other beings even if they are starving.

The wings of the Thrasher Fiend do not allow it to fly, but when it charges
against an enemy or prey, it can flutter around for a few seconds, making it
easier for it to take additional bites.
"
Thunder Salamander,"Most of these creatures inhabit a region of Crux that is usually hit by strong
storms, and do not allow anyone to approach their territory. A large group can
alter the path of lightning bolts at will and decide where they will hit with
incredible accuracy. In addition, the electricity that runs through their body
interacts with the magic around them, sometimes allowing them to replicate it
effortlessly. The authorities of Rodia strongly recommend keeping a safe
distance from these creatures.
"
Thunder Storm,"During rainy days, Storms get really angry and leave their masters’ houses or
search for clearings in the jungle. With their eyes fixed on the clouds and their
faces full of rage, these creatures begin to emit thunder and rain as if it were a
competition.

The Thunder Storm is loyal to its companions, and it only unleashes the
precise amount of electricity that it needs, to the point where it can revive a
creature whose heart has stopped.
"
Thunderstruck Phoenix,"A Phoenix Knight also has the ability to regenerate after reaching the end of
their life cycle. The last documented Phoenix Knight is Milner, who established
her bond after preventing Egas from corrupting a group of these creatures with
his dark power.

The flight of the Thunderstruck Phoenix is a wonder to behold. With each
flutter, its feathers emit an electric shock, leaving behind a trail of lightning bolts
that intertwine and sizzle in a wild dance.
"
Thunderwound Angel,"Beams of electricity traverse the Thunderwound Angel's body continously.
Touching this creature is dangerous, since they can produce discharges
powerful enough to burn a small animal to a crisp. In battle, they summon a
spear made of electricity that pierces through swords, shields, and armor,
unless they were properly enchanted to resist it.
"
Thylacine,"This extraordinary creature was seen for the first time in the Refuge of the
Magi. Its creator approached it and knelt to admire his success from up close.
The Thylacine playfully put its paws on the Mage's chest, but instead they
pierced him completely. By the time Zonte and Ainsworth reached the
basement, there were no survivors. Only the Thylacine remained. Even for
such skilled Magi, it was difficult to expel this creature from the tower.
"
Timeless Master,"When a Demigod remains mationless, its servants have no way of knowing
whether it is resting or simply ignoring them.

The Timeless Master is extremely cruel and enjoys situations in which
someone asks to trade their life for that of a loved one. After accepting the
sacrifice, it will order its servants ta inflict a wound that will make them bleed to
death. However, before this happens, it will exchange that person's life force for
that of the one that was to be saved, laughing maliciously.
"
Timeworn Ent,"Just like trees, Ents are not immune to parasites. When one of them becomes
infested, it progressively becomes a Timeworn Ent, and its life expectancy is
reduced to a few years. Aware of their limited time to help the forest, these
creatures exclusively hunt and kill humans no matter what they were doing in
the forest. A scientist from Vanelin discovered that they also lose their ability to
speak, so it is possible that their sanity is also affected.
"
Tisya,"Many mistake Tisya for a Goddess, although in truth she is closely linked to
them. Surathli and Erebyss created her shortly after the world's first cities were
established, so that mortals could have an absolutely impartial and otjective
opinion to settle their conflicts. Her word is indisputable in every kingdom, but
with the passage of centuries she began to ask for increasingly higher prices
for her services, until, at present, hearing her verdict is a privilege very few can
afford.
"
Topaz Carbuncle,"Carbuncles can only feed on ambient magic, and they do it through the gem on
their foreheads. If it is removed, they starve to death a few days later. Whether
it was for fun or part of his plans, Vertraag revealed certain secrets to the
Ravens that helped them build a new dimension to save the Carbuncles.

Topaz Carbuncles are tame and spend most of the day asleep. In addition,
they are the ones that most easily establish links with creatures of other
species, so it is very common to find them as pets in non-human towns and
cities, especially Crux.
"
Topaz Paragon,"A Paragon's weak point is its face, as the rest of its body is made of diamond
and extremely difficult to pierce. The pieces of diamond that fall from them
transform into sand when they hit the ground.

The Topaz Paragon is a restless, adventurous creature. It is curious about the
world, its history and its traditions, and never stays in the same place for long. It
is also against the indiscriminate use of magic, and one of them leads an
important movement in Ahruna to restrict its use.
"
Tormented Banshee,"Banshees are not intelligent beings, they are guided by their instinct. They
barely need to eat, and they constantly wander as if they had no purpose.

When a catastrophe is about to occur, dozens of Banshees gather around,
creating a chorus of spectral voices.

The Tormented Banshee is welcomed in some towns and cities, as it feeds on
nightmares, especially those of children.
"
Tortured Leper,"Lepers are extremely loyal to their masters, though they are banned from every
town and city of Radia. Their diet does not change after the transformation, and
they greatly appreciate a good stew.

Some crime syndicates punish traitors with a long torture and infecting them
with this disease. From that moment on, they serve their cause as slaves.
"
Torun,"WHAT THE !@#$ ARE YOU LOOKING AT? WERE YOU EXPECTING SOME
KIND OF EPIC STORY IN THESE LINES? ABOUT HOW A HIGHER POWER
CARVED ME INTO A ROCK? NO, YOU PIECE OF !@#$. THAT'S
BULL!@#$. | AM ETERNAL, AS OLD AS THE !@#8$ING UNIVERSE, AND |
DON'T LIKE YOUR PIG FACE. COME ON, WHY DON'T YOU GO DO
SOMETHING USEFUL INSTEAD OF READING MILES OF TEXT? | DON'T
KNOW WHAT THE IDIOTS WHO WROTE THIS WERE THINKING. IT
I@#$ES ME OFF THAT HUMANS ARE SO USELESS. ANYWAY. GO !@#$
YOURSELF.
"
Tower Giant,"Adult Giants vary in height between 10 and 25 feet, depending on the
subspecies and the individual, although there is one exception.

Tower Giants are among the largest, with most of them exceeding 20 feet in
height. For obvious reasons, their size is their main strength, but it is also their
weak point, as their blows are very slow, and they are an easy target for spells.
"
Toxdweller Bloodbather,"Mikhail was the most famous hitman on the other side of the Veil, on a
continent where magic could not develop, which the Gods separated from the
rest of the world. When he turned 55, he was recruited by the Auditors and
became Eve, one of their most dangerous agents.

Toxdwellers feed on the nuclear waste produced by the experiments carried
out in the Caustic Reactor. After the first outsiders reached this realm, Venedon
thought it would be a good idea to equip these creatures with extra weapons,
such as the stinger he gave the Toxdweller Bloodbather.
"
Toxdweller Decoy,"In Mikhail's continent, technology evolved at a much faster speed, which
resulted in the creation of, among other things, devastating weapons more
advanced than anything that could be conceived in the nations where magic
was a reality. In the end, one such weapon destroyed all civilization on the
other side of the Veil, after Mikhail had joined the Auditors.

The body of the Toxdweller Decoy is covered with a fiber that absorbs the toxic
fluids it encounters.
"
Toxdweller Infector,"Mikhail, or Eve, and the other five agents of his group, played roles of great
relevance to the Auditors when it came to weaving the framework that allowed
them to operate worldwide. In this way, the organization was largely able to
control the development of history.

The Toxdweller Infector has become the greatest threat to survivors on the
other side of the Veil. Because it moves with great ease thanks to its four
wings, it has spread the calamities that travel with it to more places.
"
Toxdweller Mutant,"Adter the civilization on the other side of the Veil destroyed itself with its own
weapons, the Auditors did not allow it to recover for fear that they would find a
way to reach other continents and raze the rest of the planet. Mikhail was one
of the agents tasked with ensuring this civilization did not resurface, and also
eliminating all vestiges of their knowledge about nuclear energy.

The Toxdweller Mutant does not really have three eyes or four arms, it just
seems so if one is close enough. According to recent research, inhaling the
vapors it releases causes hallucinations.
"
Toxdweller Parasite,"Mikhail never learned how to use magic and refused to use Spell Gems.
Despite this, he was one of the organization's greatest assets thanks to his
cunning, experience, and the two firearms with which he hardly ever missed a
target.

The Toxdweller Parasite feeds on blood and garbage, which makes its stinger
a weapon to be reckoned with.
"
Toxdweller Slasher,"Eve and the other five agents of his group developed a strong friendship over
the decades they worked together. When they became Gods and created their
own realms, they were isolated from the rest of the world, without even being
able to observe what was happening outside their realms.

The Toxdweller Slasher secretes a toxin that causes hallucinations within five
minutes of coming into contact with blood. This substance is gaining popularity
as a recreational drug in some of Rodia's neighboring nations.
"
Toxic Leech,"Leeches only need to touch a creature to absorb its blood. This process occurs
at an incredible speed, and they are able to drain a human being dry in a
matter of minutes.

Being in the presence of the Toxic Leech for too long alters protein synthesis in
any living creature, including magical ones, which ends up killing them unless
they receive proper treatment in time.
"
Toxic Smog,"The leader of the Spark plant was the prcject manager, a Mage who
overestimated her achievements and gave the go-ahead to the results without
performing the relevant safety checks, falsifying a series of reports. On the day
of the explosion, she was supervising the work of the operators. When the
machine failed, and everything blew up, she became the Toxic Smog. Since
then, her only concern has been to annihilate every Smog, as she would not
have been in the plant if not for their incompetence.
"
Transcended Phoenix,"When a Phoenix has been reborn forty-two times, it becomes a Transcended
Phoenix. This creature never gets old or sick, but it cannot regenerate, so steel
and magic can end its life. Females gain the ability to lay an unlimited number
of eggs, although their offspring is always of the father's subspecies. The
number of Phoenixes was considerably reduced in the Unification War. To
repopulate the species, Helmholtz and Milner searched for two Transcended
Phoenixes, a male and a female.
"
Transient Spectre,"The Transient Spectre is native to Eternity's End and was one of Sigmund's
preferred otjects of study. The curse from which most Spectres come is based
on it. Its existence is compressed in time, and its origin is an anomaly caused
by the interaction between the real world and Vertraag's realm.
"
Treasure Golem,"This rare specimen is believed to have a manufacturing defect. Self-aware, the
Treasure Golem owes its name to the fact that it enjoys collecting bright
okjects, which is why many Magi actively hunt down these creatures for their
loot. At night, it usually looks for a cave in which ta light a fire so that it can
stare at its belongings in the light of the flames until dawn.
"
Treat Imling,"Two hundred years ago, an Imling scientist tried to prove that it is possible to
resurrect the dead even after a few minutes have passed. With great care and
skill, she reconstructed the body of an Imler and managed to make it move, but
she soon understood that her creation was completely mindless. Far from
giving up, she decided that her machine, at least, would follow her orders. After
establishing a mental link with the core of the system that allowed the Imler to
move, she presented it to the public. Her work was poorly received, and she
was exiled. The Imlings finally accepted her contribution years later, though she
died of old age shortly after that. At present, some scientists of this species
specialize in creating these beings and are known as Treat Imlings.
"
Treewall Construct,"An important agricultural company run by a human woman started to use
Treewall Constructs as a labor force. After dismissing hundreds of workers and
agitating the competition, especially the Pilwiz, social unrest began to grow
right during the recent war. In the absence of the then ruler of Nex, who was in
Siralim to defeat the tyrant who threatened to conquer Radia, liberd had no
choice but to make drastic decisions during these events. Specifically, he
decreed that the number of Constructs on each company's workforce can
never exceed 3%.
"
Trepidation Wight,"These creatures used to be the great lords who led their people to a massacre
in the name of greed and power. Some even became kings. The ancient king
of Caedo had them lead his armies of the fallen, but even after he was
vanquished, they still wish to see Rodia reduced to ashes.
"
Trick Imler,"It is common knowledge nowadays that resurrecting a dead person becomes
impossible after a certain amount of time has passed. Many throughout history
have tried to challenge death, however, even in recent times. One of the
byproducts of this stubborn obsession to overcome a universal law is the Trick
Imler, a lifeless creature animated only by magical impulses that run through
an artificial nervous system. They were considered abominations at first, but in
time the Imlings accepted them as cheap labor. As these creatures are
mindless, they are capable of casting spells even with their bodies destroyed.
"
Troll Alemaster,"Some Troll Alemasters tour Rodia while protecting caravans as mercenaries.
Once they reach their destination, these Trolls often do the same thing: find the
nearest tavern in the city and spend their pay on all the barrels of beer they can
drink before fainting or starting a tavern brawl.
"
Troll Arsonist,"Although Trolls do not pose a serious threat to any seasoned traveler, these
creatures have proved to be a problem for Rodia's inhabitants for two reasons:
they are extremely prolific and prone to violence.

Troll Arsonists are especially problematic, as their main priority seems to be
burning anything that crosses their path.
"
Troll Berserker,"Many Trolls live in the mountains and lead a relatively quiet life, though they
are not as common as the warrior tribes that come down the mountain some
nights to do what they do best: make trouble.

Troll Berserkers are warriors of these tribes able to enter a sort of trance that
makes them unstoppable even when the battle is over, as they will sometimes
attack their allies when there are no enemies left to annihilate.
"
Troll King,"Everyone who has studied Troll culture agrees that if there was only one king to
rule them all, its life expectancy could probably be measured in hours. They are
the strongest individuals in their tribe, and they boast about it by fighting
bare-handed as tradition dictates. The skeleton they carry is used to intimidate
their opponents, and lets other Trolls know who that mean-looking guy in front
of them is.
"
Troll Knife Juggler,"Trolls are sometimes the center of attention in the cities, which is somehow
justified because of their history. Of course, there are some exceptions and
some Trolls make an honest living, like the Knife Jugglers that perform
fantastic shows on the streets. They still need to let off some steam, however,
so they get a little extra money by robbing travelers outside the walls.
"
Troll Necksnapper,"Many terrible monsters make the mountains their home, which can sometimes
be a problem for Trolls. Luckily, they have the Necksnappers to take care of
them. When a wild beast enters Troll territory, the Necksnapper grabs its
gigantic spiked club and walks calmly towards the threat. There is no mercy for
intruders, and an accurate blow of its weapon is enough to break the enemy's
neck.
"
Troll Youngster,"Its harmless name has a certain irony. Although it is true that the Youngster is
not very old, it is the mast dangerous warrior of the mountain tribes. It became
famous thanks to a series of rumors. As they say, it has assaulted caravans on
its own, defeated a Thylacine and even confronted an Immortal King. On the
other hand, nobody has really seen the Youngster, so it is not known whether it
is just an unfounded legend or if there actually is a young and powerful Troll
capable of such feats.
"
Trollboar,"Troll Kings usually die a few years after they reach that position. However,
some of them rule until they become too old, at which point they decide to
abdicate for their own safety... or rather, they are advised to do so. Without
exception, next to these Kings there has always been a Trollboar, a rare
specimen of the species who, despite what its appearance may suggest, is
much more intelligent than the other Trolls and pulls the King's strings from the
shadows.
"
Tsuchinoko,"The bite of a Tsuchinoko is not as dangerous as that of other animals in the
world, but its effects are quite curious. Rodia's biologists have not yet reached
a conclusion about the creature's origin, though the most supported theory
suggests they could have appeared because of a magic accident in which one
or more Alementals had been involved. Anyone bitten by a Tsuchinoko will be
inoculated with enough alcohol to get an elephant drunk.
"
Twisted Carver,"Unlike other Carvers, this creature feels no need to target a large number of
victims in a short time. Instead, it enjoys focusing on a single individual, trying
to keep them alive to inflict the maximum possible suffering. For this reason,
they are commonly employed as interrogators or executioners in some regions
of Rodia, or hired by people who want to settle a score.
"
Twisted Devil,"Whenever a human murders another in cold blood, a Twisted Devil is born in
the Torture Chamber. It spends its youth tormenting the condemned with blows
and superficial cuts of small weapons, but as an adult it wanders Rodia and
other countries to continue its misdeeds. If it survives long enough, its
techniques become more devious and less reckless, abandoning robberies and
random attacks to devote itself to organized crime.
"
Ugat,"The Ugat are elementals constructed by Torun's raw anger. Although they're
not quite so indignant that they talk in all capital letters and spout obscenities at
even the mast noble of adventurers, their quick temper is out-ranked only by
their creator. This makes the Ugat a terrifying foe to behold, especially when
encountered in hordes.
"
Unblinking Kraken,"Revenants know Krakens will attack small groups of them if they get too
hungry, so they set all kinds of ingenious traps for these creatures, as they are
a great food source for their species.

For centuries, the Unblinking Kraken was thought to cause thunderstorms on
the high seas, since many ships spotted these creatures when they occurred.
However, rather than controlling the weather, Unblinking Krakens simply enjoy
the sensation of the raindrops falling on their skin.
"
Unchained Djinn,"Eventually, Zonte and his teacher Ainsworth realized that something was wrong
in the Refuge of the Magi. Many of their friends were behaving strangely and
had become sullen and hostile. Others had disappeared with several Djinns,
never to return. Zonte and Ainsworth finally decided to give life in secret to the
Unchained, a loyal Bjinn. It told the others a story of suffering at the hands of
the Magi so they would leave the Refuge of the Magi, but its words had an
unexpected result, and the insurrection began at that very moment.
"
Undolim Seraph,"The Unification War had begun. That which Surathli feared most was unfolding
before her eyes, inexorably, endangering all her hopes.

Seraphs are incredibly long-lived, but they cannot reproduce without the
blessing of Surathli. When she gives it, a new Seraph is immediately conceived
as a sphere of light that grows and takes shape for twenty-three months.

The Undolim Seraph is the most merciful of its siblings and always cares for
them. It detests violence and, if possible, it will not spill a single drop of blood.
Protecting the innocent is what matters most to it, so it will not hesitate to join a
battle if Rodia's peace is in danger.
"
Undying Chimera,"Chimeras do need to sleep, and they have the ability to do so for long periods
of time, which allows them to stay awake for many, many days.

Undying Chimeras are quite reserved and do not usually participate in
conversations, but when they do it is always in a yelling voice, as they are
simply incapable of speaking in a lower volume. Fortunately for them, this does
not bother other Chimeras, and it is also not why these creatures are so quiet.
"
Unguided Agnostic,"At the dawn of existence, Erebyss and Surathli tried to create a ruthless
creature that would deal with the growing darkness. Angels were the final
result, but not their first attempt.

If an Unguided Agnostic manages to immobilize its opponent, it can transport
them to another plane. For some reason, their victims usually end up in the
Great Pandemonium, near or inside a pit of lava. When the Goddesses
demanded an explanation, Vulcanar only shrugged with a mocking smile.
"
Unguided Desecrator,"From the Unguided's point of view, entering Sanctum Umbra is a serious
transgression that must be punished with death. However, death is not the only
sentence these creatures carry out. Sometimes it is enough to simply hang the
offender upside down from a tree for three days, or to gently place them on the
top of a snowy mountain.

The Unguided Desecrator only inflicts physical punishment, which generally
means crushing the limbs of its victims under the weight of its powerful legs.
"
Unguided Heathen,"The Unguided are mindless creatures who can detect evil. However, what evil
is can be ambiguous, and these creatures sometimes punished others simply
for plucking an apple from a tree, or waking up too early.

The Unguided Heathen often punishes fruit and vegetable thieves who assault
farmers or merchants on the roads. It ties them by the hands and drags them
around for days, depriving them of food and water.
"
Unguided Judge,"Unlike Angels, the Unguided can hesitate when choosing a target, as they take
time to judge the severity of the actions that, in their opinion, deserve
punishment. It was for this reason that Erebyss and Surathli created the
Angels, perfect killing machines for whom good and evil mean nothing.

The Unguided Judge received its name because ancient humans and other
creatures believed it never inflicted any punishment. Soon after, they
discovered that those touched by them on the forehead for ten seconds quickly
lost the ability to speak and developed small appendages on their backs. Over
time, these appendages became wings, and their entire bodies and minds
changed until they fully became Unguided.
"
Unguided Psychic,"Erebyss and Surathli banished these creatures to a dimensional pocket.
Thousands of years later, Perdition discovered that he was able to summon
them from Sanctum Umbra.

The Unguided Psychics behave very differently from others of their kind.
Instead of punishing, they share mental images of the consequences of
supposedly evil actions, such as the corpse of an ant being dragged by other
ants into an anthill, or people laughing at a very bad joke.
"
Unguided Sadist,"As is the case with Angels, the only way to stop an Unguided from killing
indiscriminately is for a Mage to establish a bond with it, though one still needs
to be careful with it afterwards.

Killing is not enough for the Unguided Sadist, nor is any other punishment that
does not involve physical pain. These creatures were the first in history to
employ torture creatively. Erebyss and Surathli were upset as they watched
humans follow their example, to which Gonfurian had to say, ""Don't worry, you
have only hastened the inevitable"".
"
Unhinged Gorgon,"Unhinged Gorgons, like most intelligent beings, sometimes experience a
continuous flow of emotions, going from happiness to sadness in a moment
without a specific reason. However, due to a quirk that sometimes manifests in
the Gorgon and Smith species, these creatures can instill this emotional
disturbance on terrified victims just by looking at them, inflicting horrifying
suffering on them.
"
Unicorn Consecrator,"Centuries ago, Unicorns were hunted almost to extinction for the great power
said to be contained in their horns, which led to the Council of Radia issuing a
statement that denied those facts.

The Consecrator sometimes appears before injured travelers, but it does not
help everyone. Using its peculiar telepathy, it is able to find out whether the
person in front of it is an evildoer. If that is the case, that person may be
trampled before it goes back the way it came.
"
Unicorn Firewalker,"Born of primeval magic, the Unicorn Firewalker is literally the worst nightmare
of any Magi who disregard the arcane principles for their own benefit. When it
began to haunt the dreams of one of such Magi, the legendary Helmholtz, he
summoned it in Radia in an attempt to defeat it and escape the nightmares, but
instead it began to physically hunt down all of those who corrupt the ancient art
of magic... starting with him.
"
Unicorn Holycaster,"The Unicorn Holycaster's commitment to the fight against evil is absolute and it
is always on the move, looking for twisted creatures to execute. When one
grows up, the matriarch of its drove draws a cross with her horn on the back of
the aspiring new warrior. If it cannot stand the pain, it means it was not ready
and must wait another year to try again. Not being able to be marked after five
attempts or giving up the crusade is considered a disgrace in its culture and
punished with exile.
"
Unicorn Stormbringer,"The Unicorn Stormbringer owes its name to the fact that it was once believed
to attract bad weather. When it rains, it trots merrily and rolls on the ground
next to its kind, enjoying the touch of the damp grass caressing its coat. During
a war, some Stormbringers go to the cities and protect civilians from the spells
that fly everywhere through the streets.
"
Unicorn Thundercracker,"During a storm, the Unicorn Thundercracker runs electricity through its horn to
attract lightning to it just for fun. Its coat bristles when struck by lightning, and it
apparently feels a very pleasant tingling. The authorities of Rodia strongly
recommend not approaching them under these circumstances, especially
when they are in a drove, as it can easily become a competition.
"
Unicorn Vivifier,"Although they cannot speak, Unicorns are able to communicate by evoking
small sensations and images in the minds of others.

Many Magi have studied the power of the Vivifier, trying to figure out the
secrets of resurrection without much success. Indeed, even its ability to give life
to the dead is quite limited, as it does not work on those whose body has been
completely destroyed, or those who have been dead for a few minutes.
"
Unstable Shapeshifter,"Some Shapeshifters have a genetic mutation that prevents them from
maintaining a specific shape for long. They are also unable to fully control what
they transform into and fail many times, becoming a palm tree, for example,
rather than a fir. In addition, when they change shape, the result is always
disastrous and unpleasant to look at. In Shapeshifter societies, these
peculiarities are not considered strange or a defect. However, they know very
well that their transformations scare other species, so they are often in charge
of driving bad-intentioned visitors away.
"
Untamed Vortex,"Vortices were the first to help the world in the Watcher War, stopping their
advance in a series of decisive actions at the cost of thousands of Vortex
casualties.

While Aeolian was designing one of his Vortices, Torun decided to visit him to
make sure he was doing his job right. When he saw the Vortices, he frowned
and said: ""YOUR !@#8$ING CREATURES ARE WEAK. LET ME IMPROVE
THIS PIECE OF !@#$."" He then threw a Raving Storm at the incomplete
Vortex, which fused with it to form the Untamed Vortex.
"
Uralos Healer,"The Uraloses are native to an island east of Neralim, called Hutika. This island
is rich in resources, and has been the target of attacks by pirates, adventurers,
and even the kingdoms of Rodia.

Only Uralos Spellslingers who have undergone strict training since childhood
can become Healers. Furthermore, their devotion to Surathli must be
unshakable, as must the vow of poverty they will endure for the rest of their
lives.
"
Uralos Knight,"The Uraloses are widely known throughout Rodia for living in the only place in
the country that has never been conquered. This is because the Uraloses
themselves have prevented it since time immemorial.

When Uraloses go to war, their front lines, at least the ones their enemies can
perceive, always include a battalion of Uralos Knights. Their loyalty to their
people is perhaps too strong, and they have never looked favorably upon those
of their kind who deal peacefully with other species.
"
Uralos Savage,"It was not until Rodia became a country that the Uraloses began to settle in
Siralim and the other kingdoms. However, most of them prefer to stay in
Hutika, their homeland.

While Uralos culture has evolved, it is still connected to its roots thanks to the
Uralos Savages. They act as spiritual guides and perform rituals during each
phase of the lunar cycle, which hundreds of Uraloses attend even today.
"
Uralos Spearmaster,"As Uraloses always produced everything they needed in their own lands, they
never had to consider trading with other peoples. It was not until the end of the
Unification War that diplomatic relations with other kingdoms began.

Formations are an important part of this species’ battle style. Uralos
Spearmasters are always in the rear, protecting the most vulnerable fighters
from frontal charges or back attacks they did not fully expect.
"
Uralos Spellslinger,"Uraloses began to migrate and trade with other nations at the beginning of the
previous era, when the island of Hutika became too small for them.

Magic flows through the Uralos Spellslingers' veins. They can cast simple
spells since birth, but these vary depending on the lunar phases, becoming
more powerful but limited during a full moon.
"
Uralos Trickster,"The Uralos Council only considered starting diplomatic relations with the other
kingdoms of Radia when peace finally seemed to have blossomed in the
country.

Masters at tricking the senses of other creatures, Uralos Tricksters are one of
the fundamental defensive pillars of this species, as they set traps in the
forests, plains, and mountains of Hutika Island.
"
Urhul Tremor,"When a Tremor is damaged, the rocks that break off from its body orbit around
it like small satellites. Only when it has been totally destroyed do the stones
scatter on the ground, motionless.

The Scarlet Mountains are now an inactive volcano, but lava still flowed from
the craters during the Watcher War. A Raven led a group of Ophans toward
them to set a trap for the invaders. They fought a bloody battle there and
emerged victorious. After a few hours, the Urhul Tremor rose from the volcano.
"
Valentine Banshee,"The Banshees that were born closest to Erebyss did so as Valentine Banshees
because of her pain. They are unique creatures that go from town to town
guided by love. But not the real kind. A Valentine Banshee looks for people who
share their lives with someone who just wants to take advantage of them.
When one such couple is asleep, this creature places its hands on their
foreheads and exchanges their feelings towards each other.
"
Valkyrie Champion,"The city of Omnia had advanced technology that even allowed its inhabitants to
sail the skies in large airships. After Sigmund cast his Spectre curse, the
Valkyries of various kingdoms began to gather without anyone noticing.

Valkyrie Champions are fast and reckless warriors who charge through their
enemies’ spells, cutting them down with their twin swords. The ""Dance of the
Valkyries"" ended when the Champions gave their lives to destroy the engines
of the enemy ships.
"
Valkyrie Duelist,"At the end of the Unification War, only Andolin and Vanelin had forces
remaining. Although the Queen of Siralim added her Phase Warriors to that, it
was not enough to invade the city of Omnia. The only option left was to seek
the help of the Desert Priest in Ahruna, but before Helmholtz and Milner could
depart, the Duelist appeared with three hundred Valkyries behind her. This
creature is the best Valkyrie warrior, a queen of queens who leads her people
to give their lives for justice.
"
Valkyrie Knight,"Sigmund deployed his last remaining ships to bomb the outskirts of the city, not
caring about endangering the lives of his own people. When the Valkyries took
flight to face the fearsome threat, arrows and spells quickly rained down on
them. Many Valkyrie Knights died before getting through the walls, and most
did not make it to the ships. They protected their sisters, who quickly reached
the engines thanks to their sacrifice, causing the ships to fall from the sky.
"
Valkyrie Lancer,"Valkyries are warriors who seek glory in battle; a race as old as the world.
Although they rarely take sides, their sense of justice pushes them to fight
against certain evil causes. The march of the Valkyries is never silent, despite
the fact that they never communicate with each other. It is said that Valkyries
do not speak, they sing. However, Valkyrie Lancers are the only ones who do
so. Their voice sounds like a distant echo full of vigor and energy, and it fills
their allies with courage.
"
Valkyrie Priestess,"The mace of a Valkyrie Priestess glows with powerful light as it strikes her
enemies. It can also create luminous spheres, useful in dark caves or in the
dead of night. During the final battle of the Unification War, they used this ability
to confuse Sigmund's troops and get their attention.
"
Valkyrie Queen,"Valkyries were not made to sail the skies. During the seven days of the trip to
Omnia, Helmholtz modified half of the ones that accompanied him, one by
one, sa that they could fly. At the beginning of the siege, the Valkyrie Queens
responded to the enemy arrows and spells with fire and blood. They were the
first to reach the enemy ships, and they broke the barriers that protected the
engines with their powerful magic. They left the rest in the hands of the
Champions.
"
Valkyrie Scout,"A Valkyrie will never attack a defenseless person, and many of them only
challenge potential opponents who can give them an interesting battle.

The strategists of the Unification forces sent the Valkyries to attack Omnia on
their own by the north, where they knew that Sigmund would send his ships.
The Valkyrie Scout is a fast warrior with keen senses, able to find an opening in
any battle, and take advantage of it to hit her enemies.
"
Valkyrie Shieldmaiden,"Sigmund was not worried about the Valkyries until, to his surprise, dozens of
them took flight for the first time in history. In a matter of seconds, his ships
began to fall from the skies above Omnia, marking the beginning of the battle
for Rodia's unification. Today, this feat is known as the ""Dance of the
Valkyries"". The Shieldmaidens served as the vanguard of the Valkyries during
the siege of Omnia. They blocked hundreds of arrows and spells, allowing their
sisters to reach the walls.
"
Valor Chimera,"A popular board game among Chimeras that is played with many pieces and
three dice is now being produced in Siralim and other places.

Just by looking at a Valor Chimera, you can see why fighting it at range is
recommended. Its entire body is a deadly weapon, and as if that were not
enough, it can wield not one or two, but three swords at once, as well as a
shield. It is for this reason that roaring and bleating can be heard when a
Chimera battalion charges, as these creatures always occupy the front lines in
their formations.
"
Vampire Bat,"For some mysterious reason, there is one thing this little rogue loves more than
blood: small, jingling objects. Indeed, it is believed to be able to tell the value of
a metal by the sound it makes, and it will not hesitate to attack anyone who
carries a sizeable amount of gold coins. The most prestigious jewelry shops
commonly employ these creatures as fake detectors.
"
Vampiric Voidlord,"Many theorize that, after his resounding failure, Dragan could not bear the
shame and decided to move to a different continent. A short time later, the
Council of Omnia announced to its people that Cerys, their beloved ruler, had
died of a broken heart.

Although they can erase anything, Voidlords prefer intelligent, living beings.
Only Vampiric Voidlords possess the ability to control the speed at which they
erase their target from the universe. When their fangs sink into flesh, their
victim disappears slowly as the nothingness spreads from their feet until they
simply cease to be.
"
Vampiric Wolpertinger,"Wolpertingers are dangerous beasts that live mainly in high mountain areas.
Creatures like Trolls or the Smiths of the Scarlet Mountains often have trouble
with them.

Due to their unstable structure, some Wolpertingers mutate into the Vampiric
subspecies without any specific cause. This creature's visual system does not
allow it to receive clear images during the day. However, it is an insatiable
predator at night, feeding on the blood of other creatures until they are
completely dry.
"
Vanelin Seraph,"And there were winners and losers. Rodia was finally unified, but at what price?
Thousands and thousands of lives had been lost to serve the interests of a few,
and the balance of the world had been shaken.

When a Seraph loses Surathli's favor, it loses its wings, and its sword divides
into two.

The Vanelin Seraph is the fiercest and most reckless among them, the first to
charge against injustice with no regard for its own safety, consuming its own
energy to increase its strength. The edge of its blade shines with a brilliant blue
flame that few of its enemies get to see twice.
"
Vannyx,"These creatures have long been collaborating with humans and other intelligent
creatures. It all started when their ability to predict earth movements was
discovered. No more than a decade passed before the Vannyx found
themselves in the mines alongside the Rodians, preventing casualties when
there was a collapse. In return, they are fed the entrails of all kinds of animals,
especially those that are hard to sell on the market. If threatened, they quickly
dig a tunnel underground and sneak away at breakneck speed.
"
Varve Imling,"Although Imlings treat Imlers with condescension and sometimes take
advantage of their naivete, they do not let any others tease them and feel a
great attachment to them.

Varve Imlings are very aware of the tenacity with which Imlers protect them
and that they could not survive without them, so they always focus their efforts
on healing their big partners when they are attacked.
"
Vegetable Dumpling,"The meat of a Dumpling is delicious, no matter how it is cooked. Only the
wealthiest can afford to eat them, and few mercenaries have the skill required
to catch them. In addition, they have a sixth sense that warns them of any
danger, so traps are often a better option than direct confrontation. The
Vegetable Dumpling is even harder to find, and it may even be the rarest
creature in the world. Whoever catches one should know that their expertise as
a warrior and adventurer is unparalleled.
"
Venedon,"Before he became a God, Mikhail was a legendary hitman who was recruited
by the Auditors. Under the codename Eve he carried out numerous missions
for the organization, both on his own and with his group of six agents. He grew
up on the streets with a group of bandits who one by one lost their lives until
only he was left alive. He had always been a detached, cold, and calculating
person, but things began to change when he met his five companions. They
formed a powerful bond of friendship, and when he became Venedon ten years
later, he said goodbye to his friends in tears. Venedon still uses the weapons
he had while he was a mortal, two state-of-the-art fully automatic firearms
designed on the continent beyond the Veil. They also have a telescopic sight to
shoot long distances.
"
Vengeful Djinn,"When the Bjinns rebelled, they did not do it alone. A large number of Magi,
completely deranged, created two terrible creatures. The Vengeful Bjinn was to
be the ultimate Djinn, a being imbued with the power of a Nether Orb that
would punish the humans who tried to enslave them. However, they were
forced to stop its creation before it was ready. The result was a vile, ghostly
entity that materialized the deepest fear of whoever was in front of it, even if it
was another Djinn or a creature.
"
Venomous Clutcher,"Over the years, Taylor developed a special taste for mistreating people and
creatures. Sometimes he used magic, other times he experimented on them,
and yet other times he simply used sharp or pointed tools to inflict pain.

When a Clutcher grabs its victims, it always digs its nails deep into their body.
Additionally, the Venomous Clutcher uses its stinger to poison the victim,
producing a high fever and intense pain in the limbs.
"
Venomskin Spellmane,"When a female Spellmane gives birth, both parents divide the babies between
them and never see each other again, unless they mate again the following
year.

The Arachnid Nest is fraught with danger, and not only due to the huge number
of Arachnalisks and other creatures that inhabit it. Venomskins can be very
quiet, camouflaging themselves in the dark caves with great ease. They only
need to pounce on their prey and let their poisonous fur do the rest, paralyzing
or even killing it depending on the creature in question.
"
Vermowl,"Vermowils do not seem to realize they are not ordinary owls, and often cannot
supress their instinct to go hunt in the woods. As with Woodkas, owners of
these creatures must periodically check them for any food they may have
swallowed and remove it from inside their bodies. Predictably, Vermowls are
more active at night, and can even break windows if they are not allowed to go
outside for a while, unsupervised. Some mercenaries have already noticed this
and tried to hunt them down. However, these creatures are aware of their
ability to get other living beings drunk, so they always manage to slip away,
leaving behind a group of people babbling incoherently on the floor, unable to
move.
"
Vernal Wolpertinger,"When two Wolpertingers of different subspecies mate, half of the litter
resembles the mother and the other half resembles the father. The Vernal
Wolpertinger is the only one of its kind that carries its litter while hunting. On its
own it has no magical power whatsoever, but when the whole family is together
its skin emits a powerful multi-colored glow and becomes as tough as heavy
armor.
"
Vertraag,"No one really knows what his goals are, but the God of Time seems to have
been involved in most historical events of great importance. What is he always
thinking about? What are his plans? Did he, as Yseros suspects, know that an
old ruler of Siralim would betray them? None of these questions can be
answered, but it seems like Vertraag's plans always change the world in some
way. The real question is: does Vertraag want the same kind of world as the
other Gods? As the mortals? One day, we may find out.
"
Vicious Pit Worm,"Sigmund's Pit Worms emerged in small groups in front of the Valkyries. Milner
handed her Mage tunic to Helmholtz and rolled up her sleeves. One by one,
she burned, buried, froze and electrocuted the two hundred calamities that the
dark lord had sent against them.

Vicious Pit Worms spend most of their time underground, even during battles.
They constantly move through the battlefield to hurt their enemies with the
spikes on their backs.
"
Vicious Wolpertinger,"The origin of Wolpertingers can be traced back to a spectacular accident which
involved eight Nature Magi, several endangered birds and a series of complex
spells.

The Vicious Wolpertinger attacks anyone who carries a magic item. Indeed,
mountain wildlife experts know that these creatures eagerly devour artifacts,
and that it is preferable to throw away a sword or a shield as a last resort,
rather than lose one's life.
"
Vile Wolpertinger,"Magic is a mystery to the Wolpertingers, and yet they are not a mystery to
magic. These creatures rarely cast spells of their own volition. Instead, magic
spontaneously manifests around them when they are in danger.

Although the Vile Wolpertinger can hunt a great number of animals without
much trouble to obtain food, it prefers to look for the places where other
creatures hide their young and devour them without mercy.
"
Villous Wolpertinger,"This creature's sight is stunted, but it can orient itself perfectly using its other
senses. For this reason, the Villous Wolpertinger is the only one of its kind who
can pose a threat overnight, occasionally surprising the Smiths in the Scarlet
Mountains, who have taken to setting up traps to finish them off. Fortunately,
they are very noisy and never stalk their prey, so they rarely manage to cause
too much trouble for the Smiths.
"
Viper Occultist,"To prevent greedy Magi from taking the most powerful Nether Orbs for
themselves, Ainsworth and Zonte enchanted entire floors of the Refuge of the
Magi so that they would turn into endless mazes if someone tried to take an
Orb with them.

The Viper Occultist channels the kinetic energy of her body to enhance her own
spells. She is always in motion, as her structure is unstable, and she needs to
release this energy. If she stopped, she would eventually explode into a million
pieces.
"
Vipina Cherub,"Each Cherub is always wreathed in a magical aura, which have a great deal of
diversity. From blazing and burning auras to glimmering clouds of freezing cold
air, brilliant lights and impenetrable darknesses, all manner of Cherubs have
been seen and recorded throughout the ages. What they are often found to
lack however is drive or will, as most seem simply content to float about the
realms taking few wilful actions.

The flora strewn about the Vipina Cherub's body is not actually a part of it, but
are regular plants that have somehow adapted to feed on the Cherub's stored
energy. While this is a parasitism, it does not seem to cause any particular
harm to the Cherub. The blooms are potent magical reagents, but obtaining
one is difficult as the Cherub seems unwilling to allow anyone to take them.
"
Viridian Wolpertinger,"Wolpertingers only use their claws and fangs when they hunt. However, during
their mating rituals, both females and males use their horns to fight their
counterparts and choose the most appropriate partner.

Viridian Wolpertingers are the most patient of their kind. They are discreet, and
that makes them the most dangerous. They use their color to camouflage
themselves in the meadow without being detected, simply waiting until prey
approaches to go for the throat.
"
Vital Clutcher,"Thanks to his magical abilities, his great intelligence and his wiles, Taylor was
ruling over his home town by the time he turned 20. For a long time, the city
prospered. Despite the numerous rumors about Taylor's strange hobbies, no
one wanted to investigate him or ask him to step down. Centuries later, this city
would become the capital of the kingdom of Caedo.

The Vital Clutcher usually grabs its victims' legs, consuming their life energy to
weaken them and make them fall on their knees.
"
Volatile Phoenix,"Phoenixes are birds that only lay one egg during each of their life cycles. The
eggs take six months to open and must be incubated under very strict
conditions for the chick to develop successfully.

The Volatile Phoenix is the fastest and most skilled of its kind. It can plummet
and swerve sharply at the last moment, casting a powerful spell on its enemies.
"
Volatile Wolpertinger,"A Wolpertinger's clutch usually consists of ten eggs. However, the chicks are
extremely violent even at that stage and they kill each other for the food that
their mother brings them. In the end, only one or two reach maturity.

The Volatile Wolpertinger's hind legs are atrophied, so it spends most of its
time in the air or perched on the branches of trees. The experience turns these
creatures into expert air hunters, although a wing injury usually means death
for them.
"
Volcanic Efreet,"Efreets are able to speak, but their vocabulary is not very extensive, limited to
short sentences that often include pyromaniac threats and manifestations of
their contempt towards Djinns.

Tracking a Volcanic Efreet is very easy, due to the lava that constantly drips
from its body. Naturally, Magi who have these creatures under their command
should take preventive measures so that their home is not reduced to a pile of
ash and molten rock.
"
Volcanic Gargantuan,"The Volcanic Gargantuan is one the world's greatest potential natural disasters,
for obvious reasons. When Torun took the liberty of giving life to several
volcanoes, Surathli and Azural gave him a goad scolding. Vertraag also went to
the Cutthroat Jungle, if only to enjoy the show. After a long discussion, Torun
reluctantly made it so that these creatures would only be able to eject very hot
rocks, which is still highly dangerous. Luckily, the creatures can only be found
in volcanic areas.
"
Volcanic Wolpertinger,"As a result of their mutation, Wolpertingers do not need to sleep. However,
their visual system is not prepared to guide them through the darkness. The
Smiths of the Scarlet Mountains take advantage of this to lay traps during the
night.

Volcanic Wolpertingers usually choose warm places to establish their territory.
Legend has it that the entrance to the Great Pandemonium is actually in the
Frostbite Caverns, which would explain why these creatures can sometimes be
found in such a cold place.
"
Voltskin Spellmane,"Young Spellmanes usually leave their parents at the age of 8 months. If a
young Spellmane stays in its parent's territory for much longer than that, the
parent will threaten it and even attack it until it leaves.

Voltskins make their homes in stormy mountain summits. If they are struck by
lightning, their fur will safely channel the electricity to the ground under their
feet.
"
Vortex Observer,"The Vortex Observer has an omniscient knowledge of everything that happens
in the present, although its way of understanding it is different from that of the
rest of the creatures. When the Maluh Ophan was about to kill the Watcher
Sentinel, this creature prcjected images and emotions into the mind of the
legendary Ophan. The Watchers only felt fear and deep regret. They had been
wrenched from their world by accident, and they feared an invasion. That put
an end to the war and a new era began.
"
Vulcanar,"The God of Fire is the biggest prankster of the Gods. Torun hates his attitude,
and they have developed a certain rivalry over the years, though Vulcanar has
never taken it too seriously. When Vulcanar created the Pandemonium
Tokens, he included the possibility of summoning Torun just to annoy him.
Throughout history, many creatures have tried to overthrow the Elemental
King. However, they never succeed, and its inhabitants now understand that he
is the one and only ruler of the underworld.
"
Vulperry,"Even if it belonged to a Blue Blood, a soul corrupted from within could still be
absorbed by a Black Nether Orb.

Vulperries are usually affectionate and often jump up and down trying to climb
on top of their owner, who for this reason always ends up smelling of beer.
When a Vulperry gets angry, it arches its back and begins to bubble frantically.
"
Walken,"Walken was King Taylor's personal executioner thousands of years ago.
Shortly before the violent end to his reign, Walken became seriously ill and was
on the verge of death. However, Taylor appreciated his work and decided that
he would not allow a mere illness to rob him of his services: not even death
could be an excuse to quit his job. When Taylor's father, Tartarith, became a
God and murdered him, Walken was released and began to roam the world
with no purpose... until the Auditors recruited him as the executor of their plans.
Specifically, those that include the words ""tie loose ends"" and always end with
a head rolling on the ground.
"
Wall Giant,"As the size of Giants and other creatures makes it impossible to take them
through the streets or inside buildings, Magi had to come up with a spell to
shrink any creature to a more reasonable size. The spell has many restrictions
and only works with creatures that have a bond with the caster, so it is not
suitable for battle.
"
Wandering Abomination,"Although Abominations seem to lead an extremely painful and unbearable
existence, the truth is that they do not feel pain or sadness. These creatures
live in a state of perpetual obtundation and calm, and they are rather given to
slouching in the shade without doing anything.

Wandering Abominations especially prefer to ignore conflicts and devote
themselves to contemplating the landscape in silence. Unfortunately, many
criminal bands enslave them and force them to work.
"
Wandering Shade,"There was once a human empress who decreed a genocide against all
civilized, non-human creatures in her kingdom on another continent. Many of
her people collaborated for fear of reprisals, either from their neighbors or from
the armed forces. The humans' numerical superiority forced many of such
creatures into exile, until finally none remained in the kingdom, ather than
Elves. At present, the Shade she produced is the most powerful of all, and still
roams the world insatiably searching for non-human creatures to annihilate.
"
War Automaton,"After what happened at Irizen, the Automatons left the town and scattered
throughout Rodia. Today they can be seen anywhere, serving adventurers,
criminal gangs, or just wandering aimlessly.

The War Automaton is the model most commonly produced by the Rodian
government. It consumes less magic than the other Automatons, it is able to
sharpen its sword at any time using its mouth, and it has the flag of the
kingdom for which it fights drawn on its shield.
"
War Clockwork,"The Magic University of Vanelin recently developed a prcject with a group of
engineers from Kiaces that finally allowed access to Damarel. They quickly
realized that the Clockworks weren't exactly happy to see creatures from
outside.

If anyone could have seen Damarel a year before, they might have thought
both War and Battle Clockworks were mere ornaments... or warriors waiting for
battle to begin. With the arrival of outsiders, War Clockworks have begun to
move and can be found throughout the realm of the God of Falsity, ensuring
that nothing interferes with the activities of other Clockworks.
"
War Crafter,"During the Siege of Caedo, King Misery announced that one citizen would be
killed every minute unless Undolim withdrew its forces. Taking advantage of
the fact that mast of the knights were on the walls, a very angry Crystal Smith
headbutted one and stole his weapon. A riot had begun. The Smiths quickly
ascended the castle with him at the helm, until they reached the throne room.
There, the Smith fought in single combat against King Misery and ended his
life, which earned him Gonfurian's favor.
"
War Giant,"While this creature is not really a giant, it is programmed to speak like one of
them. Like other robots created by the Auditors, it has the order to exterminate
any outsider who manages to enter Ubi Concordia. In addition to its
extraordinary strength, the War Giant possesses a plasma cannon with
devastating firepower. The more it charges its shot, the further the explosion
will reach, and the stronger it will be.
"
War Golem,"The War Golem is a creature that instinctively craves battle. When it walks for
a long time without encountering an opponent, it simply attacks the trees or
stones that it finds along the way. Many have made the mistake of
underestimating its speed: despite its size and appearance, it is actually quite
agile.
"
War Priest,"Overwhelmed by the conflicts that were taking place all over the world, Lister
decided to give life to the Priests. But Gonfurian knew Yseros's plans. After all,
the birth of a God did not go unnoticed. And while Lister used his power
liberally to create his first children, the God of War corrupted one of them. The
Priest of War tried to thwart the plans of its brothers, spreading discord where
the other Priests had spread peace.
"
Waspid Guardian,"Few creatures have earned as much disdain from the people of Rodia as the
Waspids. Their sting produces pain and fever, but it is not always deadly.

Whenever there is a confrontation between two hives, the Waspid Guardians
form a circle around their queen. Their mission is to protect it at all costs from
the enemy Infiltrators, as all life in the hive would end without it, and its
offspring would become wandering Waspids.
"
Waspid Hiveleader,"The people of Radia exterminated Waspid hives without control, so the
authorities banned such activities under penalty of imprisonment.

Waspid Hiveleaders have the decisive voice in the Waspid armies, both when
attacking and when defending the hive. They help coordinate the actions of the
other Waspids with their buzzes, movements and pheromones, turning them
into a single warrior that dances a deadly dance.
"
Waspid Infiltrator,"Contrary to popular belief, most Waspids are not aggressive and only attack in
self-defense. In fact, like wasps, they are the natural predators of other
creatures that harm agricultural activities.

When Waspids detect the presence of another hive near their territory, a fierce
battle for resources begins. Waspid Infiltrators are extremely fast, and they wait
for the bulk of the army to get all the attention before quickly entering the
enemy hive and assassinating the queen.
"
Waspid Scout,"During the cold season, the Waspids of Rodia leave their colonies due to food
shortages, and establish new ones west of Undolim, near the Barrens. This is a
crucial stage because, unlike wasps, Waspid queens do not have the ability to
hibernate. The Waspid Scout is in charge of finding an ideal place to build the
new hive. When winter approaches, the queen feeds a mixture of hormones to
one of the larvae so that it develops as a Waspid Scout.
"
Waspid Slicer,"A Waspid queen's activities are mostly limited to eating, laying eggs and
deciding what its progeny will become. It is rarely seen outdoors, and to date,
none have attacked a human being or any other type of intelligent creature.

The poison of the Waspid Slicer has magical properties that increase the
potency of the poison of its sisters. After they insert their stinger, they flutter
with great strength to tear their enemy's body with it.
"
Waspid Soldier,"Waspids communicate mostly through pheromones. However, they play
specific roles in battle, and act in such a coordinated manner that they seem to
move as one.

Fascinated by the strategic deployment of the Waspids when confronting their
enemies, Gonfurian decided to create the Waspid Soldier. Unlike its sisters, it

is of warlike nature and its instincts push it to look for weapons and armor from
other creatures to improve its battle skills.
"
Waspid Worker,"Waspids build their hives in the canopies of large trees, rocky mountain slopes
and even hollow spaces in the ground. These hives usually have an oval shape
with hundreds of hexagonal holes that serve as entrances, and Waspid
Workers are in charge of their maintenance. They collect food and tend to the
larvae, and they are also the main defending force during invasions, as they
are the most numerous.
"
Watcher Sentinel,"The war against the Watchers did not begin until the Watcher Sentinel crossed
the portal to this world. The wait was over. It stood in front of a huge temple
crowded with people and unceremoniously fired countless rays through its
eyes. The temple fell to the ground, burying hundreds of people beneath it, and
that was only the beginning. The Sentinel is a relentless watchman, but what
was it watching over? Why did it leave its home dimension? The truth was not
revealed until the Ophans arrived.
"
Watchful Inquisitor,"After Zonte's ascension to godhood, the Itherian situation became a real threat
to the world, so the Auditors chose six agents to solve this problem. Their
codenames were Dawn, Twilight, Midnight, Morning Star, Eve, and Gloom.
Elinar was Morning Star before he was known as Apocranox.

Thanks to the Watchful Inquisitor's ability to fly, Inquisitors can easily weave
their webs both in their underground passages and the aboveground forests.
Satyrs often pay them to protect their homes from Etts.
"
Water Priest,"From the Faraway Enclave, the Priests spread by land, sea and air to bring
peace to the different nations of the world. The mere presence of these
creatures can calm the angriest hearts. The ongoing wars quickly stopped, and
the humans established their first kingdoms. But how long would that fictitious
peace last?

The Water Priest can alter the course of a river to temporarily direct it to
drought-stricken lands.
"
Water Salamander,"Water Salamanders rarely leave the rivers and lakes they inhabit. Their
structure remains relatively intact compared to that of the other Salamanders,
although they have extraordinary magic abilities that allow them to effortlessly
activate the effect of any enchanted item. A famous archaeologist recently
used one of these creatures to help her discover the location of an ancient
artifact inside an abandoned temple in the Cutthroat Jungle.
"
Whiptail Clutcher,"When Taylor had been ruling for ten years, he began to care less about
carrying out his more than controversial activities in secret. In a display of
arrogance and indifference, he ordered the construction of a huge underground
complex on the outskirts of the city, which he called the Torture Chamber. He
created the Whiptail Clutcher to monitor the complex, as well as to inflict pain.
This creature digs its thick nails into the necks of its victims, then lashes them
with its tail repeatedly.
"
Whiskull,"That phenomenon was called Blue Blood, and the people in whom it
manifested were able to develop magical powers at an extraordinary speed. It
often goes unnoticed, as most people do not practice magic, but the
consequences can be disastrous when that power falls into the wrong hands.

Despite its terrifying appearance, Whiskull is a playful creature that has fun
standing behind drunk people in the taverns to scare them when they turn
around.
"
Whispering Shade,"Whispering Shades are born from the death of those who deceive others to set
them against their true friends and allies. Unlike the other Shades, they do not
have any qualms about approaching small towns and villages, especially

during the night when everyone is asleep. Breathing the gas this creature
produces can cause delirium in those who are prone to distrust their friendships.
"
Whitestar Gemling,"Adter the exodus of the Carbuncles, an entire era would pass until humans
found a method to replicate the gems on their foreheads. Gemlings feel a
special affinity for Carbuncles and a deep hatred towards humans.

When the Sapphire Carbuncle appeared in the Temple of Lies, Aurum admired
it for a few seconds and decided to create the Whitestar Gemling. Unlike other
Gemlings, the Whitestar has a certain self-awareness and is not guided by just
instinct alone. Its goal is for Carbuncles to reclaim their place in the world, and
its abilities allow it to summon any Carbuncle or Gemling that is less than a
mile away.
"
Wicked Carver,"When this creature subdues its victims, it rarely ends their lives directly.
Instead, it usually cuts off one foot and leaves them somewhere away from
civilization until they bleed to death. If the victims are many, it sometimes
leaves one of them tied up and unhurt so they can watch the others die.
"
Wildfire Efreet,"When there were two Efreets left to complete the deal, Vulcanar grew weary of
Zonte's insolence and declared that it would not help the Magi take back their
tower unless he agreed to take a nice bath in the lava of the Great
Pandemonium. But Zonte had everything under control.

The temperature of the Wildfire Efreet is so high that it burns through anything
it comes into contact with. However, it feels a great aversion towards wood and
paper, and it never approaches okjects made of them.
"
Willow Construct,"Several activists for the defense of animals, forests and rivers have demanded
that the authorities of Nex use Constructs to help conserve nature and to
replant the kingdom with trees, given the massive logging that has taken place
due to the current war. The proposal has already reached the throne and has
been debated by the council, so now only the approval of the ruler is needed to
begin the massive production of Willow Constructs that will later be sent out of
the cities to serve this purpose.
"
Willow Spirit,"The Willow Spirits appeared in the meadows and forests after the humans
brought their magic to them. They appeared before Nature Magi were
recognized as a specialized branch. They are the protectors of the forest, who
watch over the lives of all the beings that inhabit it. However, they cannot tell
apart the threats to the forest from its protectors, so they simply heal the
warrior with more wounds.
"
Wind Salamander,"Wind Salamanders can rise in the air and travel great distances without
touching the ground. These creatures did not appear with the rest of the
Salamanders. They were born from the eggs of other breeds of Salamander
due to a mutation. A group of Salamanders that includes one of these
creatures is twice as dangerous, as they can greatly boost the abilities of their
kind. A few months ago, a team from the University of Natural Science in
Vanelin discovered that Wind Salamanders are sterile.
"
Winegel,"When Furness was defeated, the magic that flowed through his veins
prevented his soul from being absorbed by the Nether Orb that liberd had
handed over to the ruler of Nex. His body returned to normal, but something
about him had changed. After settling in the castle of the Nex's capital, he
discovered that he could give life to beer.

Winegel moves slowly and solemnly, looking down at the creatures it
encounters without realizing that its mere existence is absurd.
"
Winter Aspect,"When the first snowflakes cover the land in white, this creature emerges from
the snow with the help of its cane. Many people believe it causes blizzards and
ruins the crops, so it is vehemently persecuted by villagers. In reality, its
presence helps mitigate the intensity of these events. When attacked by
humans, it tries to defend itself by making them slip without causing serious
injuries.
"
Wisp Seer,"Wisp Seers are the most mysterious of their kind, as well as the most
dangerous. Most of the time they remain motionless, as if inviting those meet
them to look inside their flames. In addition to showing those who stare at them
their final moments, they also increase their emotional sensitivity before
bringing out their deepest fears. Since they first appeared, there have been
hundreds of new cases of severe mental trauma, as well as numerous deaths,
which has put the Council of Radia in a tight spot.
"
Wisp Watcher,"Although Wisps can appear anywhere, even in crowded squares filled with
market stalls, they never approach the temples of Surathli. Realizing this, a
young scientist who had been investigating these creatures had the idea of
pulverizing stones from the walls of one of the temples and tracing a wide
perimeter with the resulting pebbles. Indeed, no Wisps were able to get
through. Whether it is due to faith or the divine energy of this deity, Rodia must
now choose between defiling the temples of Surathli or remaining vulnerable in
the face of a terrible threat.

The Wisp Watcher appears as a flame that seeks to provide warmth to those
who need it on cold nights... until it opens its great eye and drives those who
look at it mad.
"
Wizard's Companion,"The inhabitants of Ubi Concordia spend most or all of their time on trivialities,
and they often fix their gaze on small rectangles that emit sound and display
moving images.

Wizard's Companions are usually found in the research centers of the Magic
University of Ubi Concordia, the only place where the Auditors allow this
research to take place. These creatures help researchers in all kinds of tasks,
especially those that could end their lives, and they are also formidable
adversaries who will protect them until their last cybernetic breath.
"
Wizard's Defender,"By no means have the Auditors managed to put an end to all the problems that
come with living in a society, or with the life itself of an intelligent creature.

Only a few inhabitants of Ubi Concordia are admitted to magic schools and
universities. Many envy them, though few dare to do anything about it. If a
person tries to hurt a magic apprentice, or steal files or magic items, they will
face the Wizard's Defender, an artificial intelligence programmed to unload a
barrage of bullets on anyone foolish enough to challenge the Auditors
themselves.
"
Wizened Snaptrap,"Like an azure halo under the ceiling of stars, Eferia performs a
phantasmagorical dance of whispers and blurred visions of what hundreds of
creatures lived through until the day a Snaptrap swallowed them whole. The
undisputed protagonists of this dance of life and death are the Wisened
Snaptraps, unforgiving hunters who also feed on other Snaptraps. When the
sun goes down and night falls, they can sometimes block the sky over the
untamed jungle with all the memories that were left inside of them.
"
Woeful Spectre,"When Sigmund cast his curse, this creature appeared in the country. It is
believed that its existence is linked to the curse, that destroying it is one of the
conditions to end it. It can tear through time with its knife and create temporal
rifts with which to move to other eras. The dark lord is said to have disappeared
through a rift when he was about to be defeated by Helmholtz and Milner.
Ancther theory is that Sigmund became this creature, and all these events
were orchestrated by Vertraag.
"
Woodka,"When the wind swings the branches of a Woodka, hundreds of droplets are
released from its body, carrying with them the characteristic aroma of ale.
Despite being a tree made of beer, this creature is always hungry. However,
the food remains floating inside its body after swallowing it, which means it is
never digested and can even rot, making the Woodka sick.
"
Woolly Arachnalisk,"Every few generations, Arachnalisks reach a peak of overpopulation that forces
the authorities to take measures to prevent hundreds of these famished
creatures from invading towns.

Wooly Arachnalisks are the quietest of their species, and usually wait for their
prey to pass near them before they pounce. They use their hair to create air
bubbles under the water of lakes and rivers and stalk their prey.
"
Wylder Chimera,"Chimeras are known to give off an unbearable smell. Each breed of Chimera
smells differently, but the Wylder Chimera takes the cake. Its smell is so
nauseating that a crime syndicate recently captured one of them to use it as a
method of torture. In battle it uses its bow and arrows, and the scythe on its left
arm can inflict lethal wounds if an enemy gets too close.
"
Wyvern Airslayer,"Wyverns are ferocious predators that play an important role in many
ecosystems. However, Wyvern Airslayers pose a problem for these
ecosystems, as they kill other creatures for pleasure instead of necessity.
There was once a Wyvern Windrider who went into the Torture Chamber and
made the mistake of facing Tartarith. The God of Punishment easily subdued
the creature and played with it for several days, corrupting its nature until it
became the first Airslayer.
"
Wyvern Daybreaker,"When Wyverns find an adversary worthy of their strength, they perch on their
legs and gather their wings as a sign of respect. Depending on what their
opponent does next, they may even join them.

Wyvern Daybreakers nest in the Frostbite Caverns, hiding their eggs in hollow
spaces on the frozen walls. Once the clutch is laid, these creatures leave the
cold regions until after their next reproductive cycle. The young must survive in
a hostile environment that punishes weakness with death.
"
Wyvern Skystalker,"No Wyvern flies as high as the Skystalker. Its vision allows it to spot prey at
great distances and even distinguish prey from more dangerous creatures.
When it finds one, it plummets at full speed and swerves at the last moment,
grabbing it with its claws and throwing it against a tree or a wall. It is considered
one of the fastest and most deadly hunters in Radia, although it rarely attacks
people.
"
Wyvern Sonicscreecher,"This creature usually flies low, moving with great skill through trees and other
obstacles in search of small herbivores and other harmless creatures to hunt.
Its scream is inaudible to most creatures due to its high frequency. However, it
is useful to stun some of its prey. Moreover, the sound it emits has magical
qualities and can return some spells to their casters.
"
Wyvern Toxicfang,"The Wyvern Toxictang is such a rare specimen that for a long time it was
considered a legend. It rarely moves during the day, and it never attacks prey
directly. Instead, it deposits the poison it produces in strategic places in the
forest, waiting for a creature to step on it or lick it by mistake. Animals such as
badgers or owls are instantly paralyzed and die within a few seconds. The
existence of this creature became known after a Flamehook Pilwiz started a
great fire in Andolin.
"
Wyvern Windrider,"Wyverns are known for their daring. Among them, the Windrider is the most
reckless by far. They are brave warriors, though some call them foolish, who
face any foe if it looks edible. They rarely come down to the surface, so their
diet is made up of all kinds of birds, including Griffons and Sphinxes. They are
not aware of the dangers that lurk on the ground, so Wyvern Windriders often
make deadly mistakes when choosing ""prey"" that is not flying.
"
Yllor,"Yllor, together with Alakadan, used to keep watch over the gates of the Refuge
of the Magi. After the incident that gave birth to the Occultists, Zonte met with
them and offered them freedom, encouraging them to travel the world. The two
creatures looked at each other with a mixture of amazement and fear, but they
finally accepted the offer, in exchange for being able to return to their job during
the winter and ""take advantage of the thermal field that surrounds the tower"".
Yllor and Alakadan were training in Vanelin with the legendary Red Hat order
when an old ruler of Siralim appeared and took over the kingdom. Yllor is very
temperamental and much naiver than his partner, often starting tavern brawls
when they visit a city.
"
Yseros,"The Goddess of Illusion is wise and powerful, always watching over the world.
Like some other Gods, she wants humans and creatures to live in harmony.
When the world is in danger, Yseros is always the first to notice, and she
sometimes mobilizes the rest of the Gods to help protect it. Yseros gathered
the Gods to act against the tyranny of an old ruler of Siralim. She suggested
Milner as their heroine, but, as usual, Vertraag got his own way and the then
ruler of Nex was chosen instead.
"
Zantai,"When the spring came, the humans of the free towns and cities mounted a
counterattack. Thanks to their numerical advantage and superior intelligence,
humans regained their hegemony with relative ease.

Some Asura are currently trying to rebuild their empire from ashes and dust.
Their leader is always known as Lord Zantai, in honor of the first Asura that
united several tribes and tried to conquer the lands that were once theirs and
raise its people to greatness.
"
Zarox Apocalypse,"Apocalypses lack the senses of sight, hearing and taste. Instead, they can
clearly detect any souls within a mile of them. They can also detect obstacles
through the vibrations their own steps produce and their impeccable sense of
touch.
"
Zealot Occultist,"Zonte never approved of his master's prcject and stayed on the sidelines, but
not without having endless arguments with her. Zonte especially distrusted the
word of Vertraag, whom he considered suspiciously condescending.

Some Magi have theorized that every Occultist carries a Nether Orb. Brenda
Milner discovered that, strangely, this seems to be true and false at the same
time, as their orbs share some of the characteristics, but also bleed and
produce pain to their owners when manipulated.
"
Zombaton,"Zombatons are symbiotic bacteria that, after finding a corpse, take the shape
they are usually seen in. They travel in groups and are friendly, but because of
their appearance they are feared and hated by many. Even so, they are very
popular among monster breeders, since they can reproduce by splitting in two
as they grow or by introducing bacteria into carrion to form another Zombaton.
Due to the persecution they are sukjected to, they are almost extinct, although
they are not aggressive. They like to collect cloth and metal to protect
themselves, they eat anything, and they dance around people they like with a
goofy smile.
"
Zonte,"From outside, Zonte saw the Refuge of the Magi trapped in columns of blue fire
that rose beyond the sky. He soon understood what had happened. The tower
was collapsing, and only he could stop the process. Inside, he saw the other
Magi, his friends and colleagues, turned into eerie copies of his master. He
hurried to point 0 and found her completely disfigured and catatonic. He had to
remove the nine Nether Orbs to save the tower, and each one would consume
seven years of his life. Looking like an old man but still feeling young, he
teleported to Siralim, built on top of a gigantic Nether Orb, to become a God
and stop the impending disaster. But he had miscalculated, for he needed a
tenth Orb. It was then that Vertraag suddenly appeared and handed it to him.
"
Zzyia Apocalypse,"This creature looks like an Apocalypse, but it is not one of them. It was
artificially created by the Auditors and ordered to stop any outsiders who enter
Ubi Concordia. The cry of the so-called Zzyia Apocalypse chills anyone who
hears it to the bone, as it was programmed to do. During the development of
this creature, the Auditors researched which sounds activated the parts of the
brain that produce fear, until they found one capable of terrorizing hundreds of
different species.
"
