Abominations are weak-willed creatures who can be easily manipulated. Their
two heads communicate by babbling, usually at the same time, and they can
understand what other people are telling them. As most Abominations used to
be humans, they are easy prey for Ghouls and Forsaken in the wild.

Flesh Abominations often join small bands of criminals or big crime syndicates
that accept them in exchange for protection.
