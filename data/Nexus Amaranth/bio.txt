No other creature is as mysterious as the Amaranth. At first, they wandered the
world. They were peaceful observers that floated from place to place, moved
by curiosity. As time went by, they approached other creatures and shared their
secrets.

During the Unification War, a large number of Nexus Amaranths moved from
all over the world to watch the bloody battles. Sigmund took advantage of the
peculiarity of these creatures to warn King Misery that he was going to be
besieged.
