All sentient creatures find the Nephilim's very presence disturbing. Even a
sadistic, unscrupulous ruler or the cruelest of criminals are terrified when one of
these creatures approaches.

When a Nephilim Shieldbreaker chooses a target, it does not attack directly,
instead seeking out those who matter most to its victim and turning them
against each other with a single touch of its shield. In this way, its victim will
have to witness in horror as their loved ones try to hurt each other in every
possible way.
