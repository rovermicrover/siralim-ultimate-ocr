The Wyvern Toxictang is such a rare specimen that for a long time it was
considered a legend. It rarely moves during the day, and it never attacks prey
directly. Instead, it deposits the poison it produces in strategic places in the
forest, waiting for a creature to step on it or lick it by mistake. Animals such as
badgers or owls are instantly paralyzed and die within a few seconds. The
existence of this creature became known after a Flamehook Pilwiz started a
great fire in Andolin.
