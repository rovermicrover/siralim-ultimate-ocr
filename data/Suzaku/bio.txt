Suzakus are majestic birds that have flown over the Great Pandemonium since
the dawn of civilization. They can withstand extremely high temperatures, even
those of lava, and they detest the cold to the point of spitting fire left and right in
order to heat up the environment. When one of these creatures thinks it has a
parasite, it dives into the magma to immediately end the parasite's life.
Vulcanar often points at these creatures while they are taking a bath to try to
convince someone to jump into the molten rock with them.
