This creature appeared recently in Rodia and, though it rarely approaches
towns and cities, it did not take long before myths and legends sprang up
around it. Although it certainly cannot steal human souls with its eyes, it does
enjoy chasing unlucky travelers, wha flee in terror when they encounter it.
