Plague Doctors have a strange fondness for traveling the world, curing any sick
creature they find.

When a Plague Alchemist finds a wounded person, it does not merely heal
their wounds. With a whisper, it asks the patient whether they were caused by
another. With just a description, this creature finds the perpetrator and waits for
them to become distracted. Then it pours the contents of its test tube into a
glass. When drunk, the strange liquid causes the same injuries on the
aggressor's body.
