Laglor was the result of one of the most ambitious prcjects that were carried
out in the Refuge of the Magi. Zonte's master, Ainsworth, participated in the
research when she was a mere apprentice. It all started with an immensely
powerful Nether Orb and the idea of creating a weapon that would allow
several Magi to channel huge amounts of magic to cast the same spell
together and even mix different ones. However, the calculations were
erroneous, as Ainsworth described in her doctoral dissertation on the creation
of magical objects using Nether Orbs as catalysts. Instead of creating the
perfect weapon, the staff came alive and did not take too well to the Magi
casting several spells on it. After disintegrating four members of the research
team, Laglor left the tower and began its mysterious pilgrimage around the
world.
