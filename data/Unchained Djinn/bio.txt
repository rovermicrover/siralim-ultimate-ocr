Eventually, Zonte and his teacher Ainsworth realized that something was wrong
in the Refuge of the Magi. Many of their friends were behaving strangely and
had become sullen and hostile. Others had disappeared with several Djinns,
never to return. Zonte and Ainsworth finally decided to give life in secret to the
Unchained, a loyal Bjinn. It told the others a story of suffering at the hands of
the Magi so they would leave the Refuge of the Magi, but its words had an
unexpected result, and the insurrection began at that very moment.
