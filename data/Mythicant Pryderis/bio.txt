Mythicants are not aggressive unless they are in danger or unless they have
been given orders. They are able to materialize words with negative
connotations and use them to harm their enemies.

In the case of Mythicant Pryderis, it is their arrows that become words once
they are fired from the bow. There are only six arrows in their quivers, but as
soon as one of them hits, it disappears and re-materializes behind it in its
original form.
