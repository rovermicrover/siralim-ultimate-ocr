Sigmund used the power of the Nether Orbs to cast his curse on Rodia. He
forced a part of Eternity's End to spill into the country through a rift, a huge
amount of temporal energy to which the dark lord gave form to terrorize the
world. During the process, one of the Orbs was corrupted and transformed into
this creature. It is believed that its existence is linked to the curse, that killing it
is one of the conditions to end it. Time is distorted around it, moving either
slower or faster.
