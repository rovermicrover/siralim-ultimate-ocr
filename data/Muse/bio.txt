Muse is almost as old as art, although for thousands of years no one knew she
existed because she has never moved beyond her realm. Her realm is one of
the few that are popular tourist destinations. The reason is very simpleâ€”all
works of art that are conceived in the world and the different realms are
manifested in the Astral Gallery as living beings. Of course, this phenomenon
attracts a multitude of thugs who want to kidnap them to sell or kill them for fun.
The Godess of Creation vehemently condemns their actions and does not
hesitate to reward anyone who helps her deal with this problem.
