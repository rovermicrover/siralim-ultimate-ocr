These dragons can emit a flashing light once a day through their horns that
blinds their enemies for several seconds. They often use this ability when they
are surrounded, which allows them to flee... most of the time. Some creatures,
such as Imps, have learned to close their eyes at the precise moment a Kirin
flashes, and have also perfected various strategies to capture them. Everyone,
even Imps, knows a Kirin's horn cannot flash when separated from its body.
However, owning one of these horns gives prestige to the Imp clan that has it.
Obviously, Kirins do not find this amusing, since even if they are never killed
and their horns grow back, they suffer during capture and extraction. For this
reason, they have started to destroy Imp houses at night, and shredding the
stolen horns with their hoofs as revenge and warning.
