The Mud Golem is the creature that inspired the legendary Mage Helmholtz to
create his artificial Golems. It is believed that it dates back to the creation of the
first Spell Gems. It hibernates during the cold season, but it is possible to see it
near abandoned temples when the weather is warmer, protecting ancient
magic that has long been lost to time.
