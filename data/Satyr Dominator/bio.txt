Like the people of Vanelin, Satyrs have extensive knowledge of the art of war.
They are great strategists and always in control of the battlefield, making it
almost impossible to catch them off guard.

For some reason, some Satyrs are born with two extra arms. These Satyr
Dominators are much more aggressive and crave battle above all else, leading
them to always be on the frontlines, and also to suffer a greater number of
wounds.
