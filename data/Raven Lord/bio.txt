Raven culture promotes pacifism and tolerance, but many of them are
corrupted by power and follow other paths. Some of these creatures actually
form or lead powerful crime syndicates.

It is generally a Raven Lord who pulls the strings. They are smart, dangerous
and very ambitious. And they like attention. Indeed, neither their crown, red
stones or staff serve a purpose other than showing off their position of power.
