This creature does not tolerate its own kind, and it lashes its two tails
threateningly when it encounters them. It is believed that its coat has magical
properties, and some small-time merchants have begun to sell concoctions
that they claim contain its essence. However, if any of these traders had
actually gotten close enough to this variety of Vulpes, they would most likely
have been bitten before they could even think of running away.
