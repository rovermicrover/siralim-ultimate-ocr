Several activists for the defense of animals, forests and rivers have demanded
that the authorities of Nex use Constructs to help conserve nature and to
replant the kingdom with trees, given the massive logging that has taken place
due to the current war. The proposal has already reached the throne and has
been debated by the council, so now only the approval of the ruler is needed to
begin the massive production of Willow Constructs that will later be sent out of
the cities to serve this purpose.
