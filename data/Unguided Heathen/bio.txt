The Unguided are mindless creatures who can detect evil. However, what evil
is can be ambiguous, and these creatures sometimes punished others simply
for plucking an apple from a tree, or waking up too early.

The Unguided Heathen often punishes fruit and vegetable thieves who assault
farmers or merchants on the roads. It ties them by the hands and drags them
around for days, depriving them of food and water.
