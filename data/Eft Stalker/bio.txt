When hunting, Efts work in groups, and their coordination is so good that they
hardly ever fail to catch their prey. They grunt to communicate their position,
and they wave their tails to indicate where they are going to move.

The Eft Stalker is an expert at camouflaging itself in nature. It usually remains
motionless while other Efts chase prey and lead them to the Stalker, so it can
deliver the coup de grace. On its own, it can hide behind a bush for hours until
some unwary animal gets too close.
