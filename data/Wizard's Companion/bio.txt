The inhabitants of Ubi Concordia spend most or all of their time on trivialities,
and they often fix their gaze on small rectangles that emit sound and display
moving images.

Wizard's Companions are usually found in the research centers of the Magic
University of Ubi Concordia, the only place where the Auditors allow this
research to take place. These creatures help researchers in all kinds of tasks,
especially those that could end their lives, and they are also formidable
adversaries who will protect them until their last cybernetic breath.
