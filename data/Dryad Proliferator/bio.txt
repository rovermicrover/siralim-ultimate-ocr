Aeolian listened to the Ents and created the Dryads from the oaks that
populated the forests. At first, they were unable to move more than half a mile

In the past, it was believed that Dryad Proliferators had the ability to create life
from nothing. However, their power only allows them to accelerate the growth
of plants, with certain limitations. If they were exceeded, they Dryads would end
up consuming themselves and the tree that gave them life.
