Contagious Cockatrices had not been seen in the entire continent until they
arrived on board one of the ships of the infamous pirate William James. There
are numerous theories and stories about these creatures, including a small
rumor that claims they come from an unknown continent in which there is no
magic. In truth, a nuclear catastrophe filled that distant land with radiation,
allowing only the most resilient Cockatrices to survive. Contagious Cockatrices
are simply immune to nuclear radiation. James's pirates breed them as poultry,
as they are also docile and resistant to many illnesses, and they have begun to
commercialize them. Other ranchers, fearing competition, have taken
advantage of these creaturesâ€™ suspicious appearance to create a hoax, saying
they carry dangerous diseases.
