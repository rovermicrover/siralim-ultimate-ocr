The Smoke Devil emerged from the ashes after a war lost in time and is unable
to think. Since then it has traveled the world in silence with a lifeless gaze,
leaving behind a mysterious cloud of dust. Wherever it goes there is anger, a
fight, an argument, or maybe even a war, as if its very presence was the
embodiment of Chaos. Although it carries a sword, it never gets into trouble
and will only use it to defend itself.
