Lister once came across a Wolpertinger clutch. Having witnessed the violence
of the chicks, he decided to intervene by completely altering the nature of these
creatures. Docile Wolpertingers sleep most of the time, and they are peaceful
and completely harmless... unless they are bothered. When one feels that it is
in danger, its murderous instincts awaken, filling it with rage and making it even
more dangerous than the rest of its kind.
