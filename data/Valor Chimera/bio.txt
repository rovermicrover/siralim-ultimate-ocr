A popular board game among Chimeras that is played with many pieces and
three dice is now being produced in Siralim and other places.

Just by looking at a Valor Chimera, you can see why fighting it at range is
recommended. Its entire body is a deadly weapon, and as if that were not
enough, it can wield not one or two, but three swords at once, as well as a
shield. It is for this reason that roaring and bleating can be heard when a
Chimera battalion charges, as these creatures always occupy the front lines in
their formations.
