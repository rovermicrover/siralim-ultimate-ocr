The Angels were created by the deities of light at the time when humans were
taking their first steps in the world. They were the first warriors and fought
against a dark power that threatened all existence at the dawn of creation.

The Angel Soulslayer is able to snatch the soul of its opponent for a few
minutes, causing a feeling of emptiness and depersonalization that has led
many of its opponents to commit suicide.
