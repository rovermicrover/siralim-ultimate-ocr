Dark, humid places are these creaturesâ€™ favorites. They share nests with bats
and never feed on them, since they get rid of mosquitoes and other insects that
could transmit diseases to them. In return, they continually give off a mist that
makes it more difficult for these winged mammals to be preyed upon. When
faced with threats, they take flight as high as possible and plummet on their
would-be hunters to finish them off.
