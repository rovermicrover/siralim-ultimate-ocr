Fifteen hundred years ago, there was a war between two kingdomsâ€”the
humans and other creatures of Ercath against the Solomons of Pherior, a
species of hominid rhinoceros that only inhabited that land. This species
believed all kingdoms had to abide by their laws, and they never surrendered,
even when not a single warrior was left alive. A necromancer Solomon who
had studied magic in Siralim managed to revive some of his own kind by
creating the Skelegoop. They say the purple, goo-looking glow surrounding its
body is the will of the Solomon to enforce their laws. At present, this species
has advanced, and it seems like it is no longer interested in imposing its laws,
although they remain very strict in their own kingdom, so Ercath, Rodia, and
other nations are paying attention to their movements just in case.
