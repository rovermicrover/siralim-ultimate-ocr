Vertraag and Erebyss had lived together in Arcadia for centuries. Faced with
the threat of the God of Darkness, Vertraag convinced him to attack Erebyss
first, saying she was the weakest. He lied. The armies of Angels and demons
devastated Arcadia in a battle that claimed thousands of lives, until Erebyss
realized there was only one way to defeat her foe. She let him pierce her skull
with his sword, then used her full power to absorb the God's darkness, which
spread through Erebyss and her realm. Vertraag appeared before a different
Erebyss. She looked drained. "Why did you not help me?" she asked. "There
can be no light without darkness," he replied.
