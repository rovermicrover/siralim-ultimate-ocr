Modern Spell Gems that do not come from the forehead of a Carbuncle were
developed in the Refuge of the Magi. However, every success comes after
numerous failures, and Gemlings were one of them.

There are many solitary Gemlings, but none of them are Crystaldunes. They
usually choose a mate of any species and spend their lives close to them, often
orbiting continuously around them.
