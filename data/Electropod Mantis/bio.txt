The Electropods are much larger creatures than the insects they are based on.
As long as they do not receive an order, they will behave identically to their
counterparts.

The edge of the Mantis Electropod's scythes is as dangerous as that of the
sharpest sword. With enough force, it can cut through metal like butter.
Sometimes, when they sway with the wind on a tree branch, it ends up split in
two.
