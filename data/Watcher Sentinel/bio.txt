The war against the Watchers did not begin until the Watcher Sentinel crossed

crowded with people and unceremoniously fired countless rays through its

that was only the beginning. The Sentinel is a relentless watchman, but what
was it watching over? Why did it leave its home dimension? The truth was not
revealed until the Ophans arrived.
