The mane and scales of the Basilisks make them greatly resilient. If they are
attacked from behind, they lean on their claws and deliver a powerful whiplash

Roaring Basilisks have the mast powerful voice of their kind. When they are
young and cannot control their power, their voice makes everyone around them
faint. It takes these creatures years of practice to avoid knocking out their allies
as well as their enemies.
