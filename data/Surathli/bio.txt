The Goddess of Light detests war and its terrible effects. Throughout history
she has tried to stop numerous conflicts that threatened the world. At present,
she regrets having helped a ruler of Siralim rise against Rodia and the Gods
themselves. Surathli understands that it was her greed for Emblems and that of
the other Gods that gave this person so much power. When the Gods
gathered, Surathli declared that from then on, they would only accept the
Emblems that had fallen in their own realms.
