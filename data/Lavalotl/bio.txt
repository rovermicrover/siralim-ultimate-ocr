Lavalotls are chatty, noisy pranksters wha live in the Great Pandemonium,
playing and laughing with their kind. Their games, however, often include
dangerous practices, such as pushing each other into the hot lava, resulting in
instant death for the pushed Lavalotl. Vulcanar enjoys conversing with these
creatures and often participates in their card games, betting large treasures
against them.
