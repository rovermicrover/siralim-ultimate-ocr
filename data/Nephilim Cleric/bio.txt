When Arcadia became the Path of the Damned, the Angels who had survived
the epic battle transformed into the Nephilim.

Of all the Nephilim, the Cleric is probably the mast dangerous. A low murmur
heralds its presence, similar to that of the wind caressing the ruins of a
desolate city. Anyone who listens to it long enough will become an agent of evil
until this creature is destroyed. The more light there is in that person's heart,
the longer it will take to be converted, and the crueler their acts will be.
