Gargoyles are not self-aware. They are simply guided by certain instructions
that are determined during the process of their creation. However, the people of
Undolim have always just considered them to be reserved creatures.

During the day, Sunclaw Gargoyles fly high for hours to absorb solar energy. In
this way, they generate an aura of light that allows their allies to navigate even
the deepest darkness.
