Due to their form, Basilisks move awkwardly and at a very low speed.
However, these creatures possess an enormous strength, as well as claws that
do not break easily despite their fragile appearance, which allows them to
easily pierce shields and metal armor.

The scream of the Lurking Basilisk was thought for a long time to inflict serious
injuries. The Magic University of Andolin discovered that their scream actually
stops time for fifteen seconds, which allows them to attack all their enemies.
