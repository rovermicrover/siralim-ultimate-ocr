This is the largest Dumpling by far, an unusual specimen that cannot be found
easily. It lives in small palaces that have mysteriously been built in impossible
places, such as cold, rugged mountains without any flora or fauna, hidden from
view from almast every angle. These buildings are the birthplace of all
Dumplings, so they are riddled with these endearing creatures. Some are of the
opinion that this story is nothing more than a fairytale, while others desperately
search for the King Dumpling's home so they can capture all possible
Dumplings and earn a fortune. If threatened, King Dumpling becomes a
formidable foe that all Dumplings obey without question.
