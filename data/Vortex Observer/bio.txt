The Vortex Observer has an omniscient knowledge of everything that happens
in the present, although its way of understanding it is different from that of the
rest of the creatures. When the Maluh Ophan was about to kill the Watcher
Sentinel, this creature prcjected images and emotions into the mind of the
legendary Ophan. The Watchers only felt fear and deep regret. They had been
wrenched from their world by accident, and they feared an invasion. That put
an end to the war and a new era began.
