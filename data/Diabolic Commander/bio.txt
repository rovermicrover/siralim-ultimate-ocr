Diabolic Commanders are usually veterans of the Diabolic Horde that have
emerged victorious in numerous battles over the years and lived long enough
to tell their tales. Their authority over their squad is indisputable and their
decisions are never questioned, though they are usually open to suggestions
when it comes to designing a strategy or a battle plan. They are the only ones
in contact with the Diabolic Bhuta, the Supreme Leader of the Horde that
directs their operations from the shadows.
