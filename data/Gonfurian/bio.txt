The God of War delights in the conflicts that constantly plague the world. He
always acknowledges warlike feats, and far from being satisfied with
congratulating the great warriors of history, he grants them immortality and the
power to fight for eternity as his Chosen. Sometimes, he lets himself be found
by certain warriors in hopes of being challenged to a duel. However, until the
arrival of the current ruler of Siralim, no one had managed to defeat him.
