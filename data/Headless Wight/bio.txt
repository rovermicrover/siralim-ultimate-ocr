â€˜When nightborne mist shrouds the moon's palest eye

In colder days with no warmth from the sky

Travel not late my friend, and not alone

The horseman walks, to rend your flesh from bone!

No head he needs, nor eyes to see your fear

By wicked laughter you will know he's near

One axe blow will be the last thing you see

Before he departs, laughing cruelly"

- Seasonal folk song by Undolim's famous songstress Nieve Frost
