Egas the Necromancer was a particularly important person during the
Unification War. He convinced the rulers of the small kingdoms in the West to
serve his purpose. He was a great Death Mage who, after conducting
numerous experiments, found the key to creating life from death. Before his
defeat at the hands of the legendary Mage Helmholtz, he used his own spell on
himself to remain in this world and kept working to achieve his goal of one day
ruling over Rodia.
