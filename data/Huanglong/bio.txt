These creatures often take human forms to observe the daily life that takes
place in Rodia and other nations. However, they never interact with anyone or
bother to learn any languages. They just enjoy watching people, especially
when they are happy. In their dragon form they only interact with other dragons,
and often promote peaceful attitudes. Indeed, on many occasions they receive
visits from one or more dragons who seek their help to settle their differences.
However, a few of them end up following dark paths after witnessing the greed
and selfishness of other species.
