Imlings are as intelligent as humans, and their aptitude for magic far surpasses
that of the Imlers. Because of that, the bond that unites both races is especially
dangerous for their enemies.

Leda Imlings believe that taking care of the Imlers is their responsibility, and
never take advantage of them. When they see an Imler trying to leave the
village on its own, they run after it to join it in its journey or ask it to change its
mind if they feel it is too dangerous.
