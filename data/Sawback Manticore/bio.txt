Manticores were a calamity for humans during the rise of their early
civilizations. Today, children are still warned of the dangers that these creatures
entail.

The Sawback Manticore shows many openings while it fights, waiting for its
opponent to strike before crouching and becoming a deadly trap. It can also roll
across the floor like a spiked ball and throw itself on its enemies if they are far
enough.
