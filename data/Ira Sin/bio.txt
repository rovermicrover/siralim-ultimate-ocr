The Sin cult is relatively widespread in Radia. Its members perform strange
rituals that can summon these creatures by sacrificing others.

When the Kings met before the Unification War, an Ira Sin manifested in the
room in which they were assembled. Milner (who attended the meeting as the
King of Neralim's bodyguard) and Sigmund destroyed it in seconds. However,
that event marked the beginning of the Unification War.
