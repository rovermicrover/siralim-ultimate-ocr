The Apis walked freely through the streets of the cities and towns of Kaito.
People fed these creatures regularly, and they were cared for whenever they
became ill.

When the blue protrusion between the horns of an Apis Defender begins to
glow softly, the wounds its allies would receive are transferred to this creature.
For this reason, the Apis Defender is commonly seen accompanying armies
and gangs of raiders, who sometimes abuse its extraordinary ability until it dies.
