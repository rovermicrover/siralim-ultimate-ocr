When Siralim began its conquest of Rodia, its ruler transformed some people
into fearsome creatures to help conquer the country.

The Lagergoyle likes to perch on a tavern's counter and watch the customers.
If it believes they are not drunk enough after some time, it starts moving around
the tables and lets them drink from its body. These creatures are banned from
most cities for this reason.
