A Reaper sometimes appears when someone dies, remaining there for a
moment before disappearing. This led to the popular belief that these creatures
accompany the souls of the deceased to the afterlife.

During his stay in Eternity's End, Sigmund met and befriended a Bone Reaper.
This was an unprecedented event in history, and it led to the discovery that
anyone who wears a Reaper's tunic automatically knows the life expectancy of
any creature except their own.
