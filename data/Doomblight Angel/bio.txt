This creature was created in times of need to mercilessly annihilate anything
that crossed its path. When one of them stumbles upon a town, it does not stop
until either someone stops it or it kills every single inhabitant. Like the rest of
the Angels, they fought on the side of the Gods in an ancient war. To achieve
victory, a sacrifice was necessary, as there can be no light without darkness.
Someone had to contain that darkness, but only the wisest of them, the eternal
one, knew that secret.
