Giants have a tough, violent and utterly disrespectful personality, as well as a
mean face, all in the image and likeness of their one true God.

Thanks to the composition of its body, the Sand Giant can regenerate any of its
limbs in a matter of seconds as long as it is still alive. When Vulcanar saw this
huge and "I@#$ING MAJESTIC" creature, he decided to ignore the advice of
the Goddess of Illusion and create something that stood out even more in order
to irritate the God of Anger.
