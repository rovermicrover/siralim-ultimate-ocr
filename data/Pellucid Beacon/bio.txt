Beacons do not interfere with the fauna and flora of the forest they inhabit.
However, visitors must be extremely careful, as Beacons have been known to
mercilessly attack together when they witnessed the slightest interference.

The Pellucid Beacon's colors flash with great intensity when it enters combat. It
uses this ability to make the direction of its movement more difficult to predict,
as well as to intimidate its enemies.
