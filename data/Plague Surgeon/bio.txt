To diagnose their patients, Plague Doctors observe them closely for a while,
explore their bodies, and demand information from the people around them,
pointing first to the patient and then to their mouths.

The Plague Surgeon is an expert in open-body surgery. Sometimes it finds that
a disease has been caused by someone else. In such cases, the author of the
damage awakens one morning with the same affliction, and no Plague Doctor
will watch over them.
