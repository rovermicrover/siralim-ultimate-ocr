The Diabolic Rebel is truly a born leader among its people. It is always the one
with the decisive voice and it never fails to encourage its comrades-in-arms
with promises of glory and blood. Daring and tough, it is the first to jump into
battle, shouting loudly as it uses its twin torches to create a whirling vortex of
fire.
