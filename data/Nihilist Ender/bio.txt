Nihilists appeared all over the world very recently. Most of them roam in small
groups, though they sometimes gather in large numbers.

While any Nihilist can take down a Voidlord, none do it as well as the Nihilist
Ender. In addition to sensing the presence of any Voidlords within a mile of it,
its weapon deals incredible damage to these creatures, disintegrating them the
moment they pierce their bodies.
