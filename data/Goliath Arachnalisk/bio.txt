Although its poison is not lethal, the Goliath Arachnalisk is the largest of its
siblings. It lives deep in forests and tends to avoid clearings, which is why
forest-dwelling Familiars usually settle in them. This creature is a born hunter
that attacks any creature of similar or smaller size even when it is not hungry,
as its web can preserve food for several days.
