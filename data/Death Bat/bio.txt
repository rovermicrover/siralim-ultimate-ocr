A long time ago, there was a Mutated Vampire Bat who stood out above the
rest in its knowledge of magic. It owned a large mansion and enjoyed
performing experiments in the company of other Bats. Needless to say,
something went very wrong, and its home blew up in an emerald-green blast,
giving birth to this Bat subspecies as a result. Now, Death Bats seek revenge
against magic itself.
