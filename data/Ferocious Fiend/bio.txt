The first Fiends lived in the Great Pandemonium with Vulcanar. The God of
Fire was very satisfied with his creations, but he had no choice but to exile
most of them, as they would have eventually wiped out all other creatures in his
realm.

When a Ferocious Fiend cannot get close enough to bite its enemies, it uses
the pointed end of its tail to pierce through them. Some Carvers train young
Ferocious Fiends to use them as mounts and shock troops once they grow up.
