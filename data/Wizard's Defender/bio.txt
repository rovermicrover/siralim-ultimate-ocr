By no means have the Auditors managed to put an end to all the problems that
come with living in a society, or with the life itself of an intelligent creature.

Only a few inhabitants of Ubi Concordia are admitted to magic schools and
universities. Many envy them, though few dare to do anything about it. If a
person tries to hurt a magic apprentice, or steal files or magic items, they will
face the Wizard's Defender, an artificial intelligence programmed to unload a
barrage of bullets on anyone foolish enough to challenge the Auditors
themselves.
