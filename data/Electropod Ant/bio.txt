The Electropads were designed by a scientist in the north of the continent, a
long way from Radia. In that place, magic has developed more slowly, as the
number of Nether Orbs found there is not very high.

The Ant Electropod loves to lift all kinds of things when it is not complying with
any order, but its strength is not proportional to a real ant, so on more than one
occasion it has destroyed its mandibles or other parts of its body when trying to
lift an object that was too heavy.
