This creature is not really a Reaper, but an automaton created to eliminate
anyone who enters the city of Ubi Concordia without the Auditorsâ€™ permission. It
handles its scythe formidably, and it does not need to hold it at all to strike with
it. Trying to snatch its weapon away is a mistake, as the scythe can deliver a
powerful electric shock if it is being held by anyone other than its owner.
