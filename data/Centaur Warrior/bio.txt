Centaurs have been enemies with the Elves of the Cutthroat Jungle for
centuries, even before the Unification of Rodia.

Naturally, Warriors form the bulk of their armies, and though their training is not
as hard as that of the other ranks, they tend to be better prepared for battle, as
it is their only focus. Their marches are known to be extremely quiet, but that is
because most Centaurs take advantage of their ability to take a nap while
galloping.
