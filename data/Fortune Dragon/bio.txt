This creature's name is cruelly ironic. When the claws of a Fortune Dragon
pierce an enemy's flesh, they transmit an infectious disease that is lethal if left
untreated for twenty-four hours. Dragon Queens usually have them attack any
outsiders who break the laws of the Unsullied Meadows, leaving them alive.
This is meant to serve as a warning due to the extreme pain the victims suffer
during the course of the disease.
