Regalis created this creature to face the Creeping Arachnalisk and teach the
God of Time a lesson. She even had him witness the encounter. When
Vertraag saw how the creature that would fight his creation really looked like an
alien, he knew his words had not hurt Regalis in the least, but rather
encouraged her. The battle was over in a heartbeat, as the poison produced by
the Mite Paralyzer can stun even an elephant. Then, Regalis turned to Vertraag
and congratulated him sarcastically on his dirty trick.
