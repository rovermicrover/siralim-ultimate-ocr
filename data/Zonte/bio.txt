From outside, Zonte saw the Refuge of the Magi trapped in columns of blue fire
that rose beyond the sky. He soon understood what had happened. The tower
was collapsing, and only he could stop the process. Inside, he saw the other
Magi, his friends and colleagues, turned into eerie copies of his master. He
hurried to point 0 and found her completely disfigured and catatonic. He had to
remove the nine Nether Orbs to save the tower, and each one would consume
seven years of his life. Looking like an old man but still feeling young, he
teleported to Siralim, built on top of a gigantic Nether Orb, to become a God
and stop the impending disaster. But he had miscalculated, for he needed a
tenth Orb. It was then that Vertraag suddenly appeared and handed it to him.
