No mortal knows for certain how the Siren Soothsayers came to be. Some
believe they were born from the laughter of Lister. Others, that they were
created by Tartarith to torment humans. When the gem on their forehead
begins to glow, every creature around them receives visions of horrible events,
and an unquestionable certainty that they will come to pass in the future.
However, this only happens in battle. Some testimonies state that the glow
produces hopeful images in other situations.
