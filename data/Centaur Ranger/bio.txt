Only the centaurs with the keenest eyesight can promote to the rank of Ranger.
This is largely due to the fact that this species has poor night vision, a big
disadvantage when their strategy requires them to gallop at night. Centaur
Rangers are able to interpret footprints and use them to estimate the direction
taken by the enemy, something that in many cases allows them to lay a perfect
ambush, shooting comfortably at their opponents from a safe distance.
