The day to say goodbye had come. Mikhail, Elinar, Vyre, Hexilo, and River
ceased to be what they once were. Their last mission for the Auditors was
carried out: to save not only the world, but the entire universe from an
inexorable end. Their five new realms were ready, and the only thing that
remained was saying goodbye. Everyone except Mortem and Tenebris set out
on their journeys. "River," said the god of Blood. "It's Tenebris now, speak
properly," he replied. "You weren't always so compliant with the rules.‚Äù
Tenebris smiled at his response. "You took Linta, you heathen." "I know, so |
want to give you something." The Darksulker appeared next to Tenebris.
Mortem knew Tenebris was raising an eyebrow under his cloak of darkness,
even though he couldn't see it. "Come on, don't look at me like that. It's very
smart, I've told it about you and it agreed. I'm sure you'll be great friends." The
Gods embraced each other, so tightly that the earth itself trembled. "Goodbye,
Mortem." "I'll miss you, Tenebris."
