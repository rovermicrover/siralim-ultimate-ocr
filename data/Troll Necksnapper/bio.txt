Many terrible monsters make the mountains their home, which can sometimes
be a problem for Trolls. Luckily, they have the Necksnappers to take care of
them. When a wild beast enters Troll territory, the Necksnapper grabs its
gigantic spiked club and walks calmly towards the threat. There is no mercy for
intruders, and an accurate blow of its weapon is enough to break the enemy's
neck.
