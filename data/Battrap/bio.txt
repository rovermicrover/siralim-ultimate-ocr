Even though Eferia is part of Torun's realm, the Ak'haruts blocked access to it
through Teleportation Shrines and similar portals which adventurers and looters
have been using to travel for over a thousand years.

Snaptraps can uproot themselves and walk on their roots. Although they lack
intelligence, their ability to navigate their surroundings and respond to the
stimuli around them is impressive.

The Battrap is the only Snaptrap in Eferia that does not feed on birds,
mammals or reptiles, but on insects and feces. If another predator, including
other Snaptraps, tries to devour it or the animals it shelters, it will either attack
or flee depending on its chances.
