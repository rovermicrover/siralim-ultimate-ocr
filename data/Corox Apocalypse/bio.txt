The Corox Apocalypse is a 35-foot long legendary creature, capable of piercing
the hardest skin and doing all those things gargantuan monsters with a
redundantly terrifying appearance usually do. The clash of titans between it and
the Mystical Giant was reducing the city to rubble while the Maluh Ophan and
the Watcher Sentinel fought their own battle. Punches, bites and headbutts
turned buildings to dust while the Ophan tried to fix the world. Until, finally, the
Carnage Devourer appeared.
