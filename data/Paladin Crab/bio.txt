For centuries, Lister watched the Imps of his realm overhunt shame-faced
crabs. One day, he opened his eyes and found one of these crustaceans
sleeping next to him. As time passed, more crabs gathered around him. They
had learned that being close to the God of Fortune was the easiest way for
them to survive. In time, Lister grew fond of them and finally decided these
animals needed protection. For this purpose he created the Paladin Crab, a
creature that would gladly give its life to prevent its weaker kin from being
eaten, no matter who dares to try.
