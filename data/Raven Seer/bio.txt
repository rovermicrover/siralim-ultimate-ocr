Raven Seers are seasoned psychics, capable of conjuring up images in other
creaturesâ€™ minds and reading their thoughts. Many of them take advantage of
their powers to offer what they call clairvoyance services in exchange for a lot
of money. Rodia's authorities pursue these activities, as they are considered
fraud, but not anyone can stop these creatures. Generally, one or two veteran
Magi with extensive knowledge of mentalism accompany the guard in charge
of arresting a Raven Seer who is committing this crime.
