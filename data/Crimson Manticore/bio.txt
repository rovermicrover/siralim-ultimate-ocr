Few species have been created for the sole purpose of eliminating another.
Indeed, only one â€” Manticores. Their target: mankind.

The Crimson Manticore can smell the blood of a human at great distances.
When it finds its target, it moves stealthily, crouching, aware of where it places
its paws so as not to step on a branch or a pile of dry leaves. The victim will not
see this creature coming, as it always attacks from behind.
