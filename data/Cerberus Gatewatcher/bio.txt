Out of their three heads, only the middle one is sentient. "After all, if all three
had to agree on where to move, at the end of the day they would only have
managed to pee themselves." This is a quote by Dr. Fechner, a physiologist
who studied Cerberus brains for twenty-five years and discovered that the side
heads can only perform two actions: stare at whatever comes close and bite it
relentlessly.

Cerberus Gatewatchers, as their name implies, guard the entrance to the
Great Pandemonium.
