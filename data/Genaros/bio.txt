In the distant kingdom of Kiaces, hunting was revered for dozens of
generations, so much so that its cult spread beyond its borders. That faith that
traveled almost the entire continent gave life to Genaros, a God who, far from
being vengeful, even extolled indiscriminate slaughter as long as it had the
purpose of filling the stomach of another living being. However, over time he
was forgotten and the borders of his realm simply ceased to be seen with the
naked eye. Recently, a group of Radian Magi found a way to enter the
Overgrown Temple, causing that mist to disappear. Genaros is always talking
about hunting and does not tolerate any type of violence that is not related to
survival in the strictest sense of the word. He charges with all his anger against
any criminal who enters his realm.
