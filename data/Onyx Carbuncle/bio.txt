Once the Watcher War was over, the Ravens tried to get in touch with the
Gods so they could intervene on behalf of the Carbuncles, but none of them
answered their demands.

Any magic item around a Carbuncle reacts to its presence in sometimes
imperceptible ways.

Onyx Carbuncles are curious and unruly, and they kept sneaking into human
homes to steal food or simply open the kitchen cupboards and throw everything
to the floor for fun, even when they were being hunted. When a magic item
touches their fur, it turns black permanently.
