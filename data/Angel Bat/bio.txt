This creature sleeps at night and goes hunting when the sunlight begins to
appear on the horizon. It usually inhabits cold places and migrates when the
warm season arrives, if the temperature is not low enough for snow, as they
sleep and nest in rocky crags covered with snow to hide from predators, only
sticking their heads out.
