Legend has it that Caliban was born from Lister's dreams, but his nature is
nothing like that of his supposed creator. Unable to manifest himself in the real
world, this God began to appear in the dreams of influential people, aiming to
be worshipped, and to gain the power to escape the world of dreams. Caliban
feels so envious of the other Gads, he wishes to get rid of them at any cost,
and then take over Rodia and the rest of the world... or even destroy it. After
the war ended, Rodian scientists found that the remains of his body reacted
slightly in the presence of images of the Goddess of Darkness.
