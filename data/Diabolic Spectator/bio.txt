The Diabolic Spectator never stops exercising its muscles, even while traveling,
as it relies on its own fists to bring down its enemies. When two
comrades-in-arms decide to resolve their differences by means of violence, this
creature usually tries to mediate between them by puffing its chest and
throwing a defiant look. This usually ends with the three of them fighting on the
ground, so it's hard to tell whether its intention is really to stop the conflict or to
join it as a show of strength.
