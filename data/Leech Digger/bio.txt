The colossal creature whom Mortem named Titan was floating in an
interdimensional space near the edge of reality. To reach it, he was aided by
Perdition's older sister, a member of the Auditors with extensive knowledge of
magic and the structure of the universe.

The Leech Digger uses its powerful hands to hide underground, waiting for an
animal to pass over it. If it chooses the wrong place, instead of surfacing to
choose a better one, it just stands still until it starves to death.
