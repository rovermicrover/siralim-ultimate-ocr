Hunter groups seem to move without any concrete goals. However, on rare
occasions they travel Rodia with the purpose of fighting injustice. Such groups
are always led by a Hunter who, instead of a shuriken, wields a bow and arrows
made of the metal of its old throwing weapon. Some scholars of non-human
societies have determined that it symbolizes their decision to abandon their old
life. Others say that it is a custom handed down from generation to generation.
