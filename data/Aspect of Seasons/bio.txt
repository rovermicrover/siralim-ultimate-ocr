The purpose of this creature is to ensure that the rest of the Aspects do the
jobs for which they are regularly created, but its main concern in recent
centuries has been to protect them from those who sometimes attack them out
of fear or unfounded hate. Unlike the other seasonal Aspects, it uses lethal
force against anyone who opposes its mission. Moreover, its powers can bring
balance to any and all seasonal adversities.
