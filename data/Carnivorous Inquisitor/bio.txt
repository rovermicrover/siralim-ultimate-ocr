Apocranox was once a mighty warrior of the forests known as Elinar. The
Auditors were quick to recruit him and give him eternal life, just as they did with
the other five agents who were part of his group. He brought a large number of
Arachnalisks with him to the Blood Grove, and when they drank from its rivers
they changed and became the Inquisitors.

The Carnivorous Inquisitor uses its claws to tear apart its prey before eating it,
but is forbidden from using them to attack Ets, as they can easily slip away if
their tails are cut off.
