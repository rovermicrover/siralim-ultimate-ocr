The authorities of Rodia forbid the cultivation of corn to any species other than
the Pilwiz, due to the mysterious accidents that the competition would
otherwise suffer. In exchange, the Council of Economy has a say in the prices
of corn to prevent abuse.

The Flamehook Pilwiz is immune to the heat of fire. It has an essential job, as it
can absorb fire to save the crops if necessary. They sometimes come into
conflict with the Ents, as they burn forest plots to cultivate them.
