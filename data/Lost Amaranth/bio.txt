When an Amaranth dies, it rises beyond the clouds and explodes into a
thousand pieces. Not even Sigmund, Helmholtz or the Gods know that
Emblems are actually the result of this explosion.

Unlike the rest of the Amaranths, the Lost Amaranth does not stop to observe
the world. Instead, it travels with groups of humans and other nomadic
creatures, protecting them with its very presence.
