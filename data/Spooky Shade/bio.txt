Spooky Shades are born from the death of spies. Their instincts drive them to
hide their identity by masking their appearance, which works as well as can be
expected from a Shade. However, since these creatures can briefly put images
of anything they've seen into the mind of another, many spies that work for
sovereigns or crime syndicates continue doing so after death.
