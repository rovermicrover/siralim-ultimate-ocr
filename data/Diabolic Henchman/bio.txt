The Diabolic Henchman usually acts as a scout when it travels with other
members of the Diabolic Horde. It examines footprints and other signs left
behind by enemies, allowing the Diabolic Horde to track them and deal with
them. Its secondary job is to hunt wild animals and to light fires at night that
improve the mood while the Diabolic Commander tells war stories.
