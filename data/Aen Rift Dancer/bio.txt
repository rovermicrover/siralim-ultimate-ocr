Rift Dancers are believed to be from another world, having ended up in ours as
a result of an abuse of magic. Although they do not need to eat, they are
sometimes seen in abandoned temples, enveloping magical items with their
bodies.

Aen Rift Dancers often gather in hills far from the cities during clear nights, and
remain under the stars for hours, emitting a soft murmur as if they yearned for
their light.
