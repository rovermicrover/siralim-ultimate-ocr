Adter their rebellion, many Familiars went north and established a community in
an old tower, inhabited only by Cornell and other Grimoires since the
Apollinaire Massacre. There, they filled the looted shelves with books of
science and magic.

Palace Familiars are distinguished members of their community, who
established the Council which decides on matters of trade, the provisioning of
the tower, and Familiar activities. In battle, they throw their scepters at their
enemies, then call their weapons back with telekinesis.
