Basilisks are usually between six and seven feet in length, and feed on all kinds
of creatures or carrion. These creatures do not take risks when they are alone,
and generally avoid attacking creatures their own size.

Out of all the Basilisks, there is only one that does not scream in battle.
Instead, it makes an inhaling sound that, after a few seconds, ends up
absorbing all the magic around it.
