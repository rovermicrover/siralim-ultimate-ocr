When these Plague Doctors find a badly injured person in risk of bleeding out,
they perform a blood transfusion. Indeed, humans and other intelligent species
learned this technique from them, as well as the fact that not all blood types are
compatible. If a Plague Phlebotomist's patient was injured unjustly by another
creature, it will sneak into their room while they are sleeping and draw all the
blood they can without ending the creature's life.
