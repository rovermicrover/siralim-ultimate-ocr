The Cinder Devil likes to hide in dark neighborhoods and look for drunk people
who walk aimlessly at night. When it finds one, it stands behind them and
follows behind. Suddenly, its sword hits the ground and the blade begins to
crack the paving stones. The drunk person turns with a start and sees a figure
wrapped in darkness. Before they can think of what to do, the Cinder Devil
lights a fire in its right hand, and the slaughter begins.
