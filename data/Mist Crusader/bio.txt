When several Mist Crusaders gather in a large group, a cloud of steam forms
around them that prevents anyone from seeing what is happening inside it.
This event has only taken place a few times in history; sometimes to protect
the creatures of the forest, other times to bring justice to gangs of marauders
that ravaged villages and small towns. Warrior tribes and criminals who
perform such activities keep watch at night in case the mysterious mist appears
in the distance.
