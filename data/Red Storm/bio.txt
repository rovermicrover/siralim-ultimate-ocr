When a Storm gets angry with its master, it often decides to rain in the middle
of the living room while cursing loudly. They snore when they sleep, which
produces quiet thunder sounds that some people actually find relaxing, though
they also grumble from time to time.

Whenever a Red Storm meets a Blood Slime, they play by casting spells and
lightning bolts at each other. If something threatens or scares its playmate, the
Red Storm unleashes all its fury.
