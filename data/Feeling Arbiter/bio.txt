The world is full of intelligent creatures, and some stand out from the rest in
one or more respects. Many attract the attention of the Auditors but, because of
their behavior or their way of thinking, they are not considered suitable to carry

they intervene in an argument between two people, they sometimes decide to
cast a silencing spell on one of them if that person is not listening to what the
other one says.
