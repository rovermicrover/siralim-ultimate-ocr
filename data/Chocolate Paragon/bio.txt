These creatures owe their name to their uncanny resemblance to a chocolate
bar. Their history goes back to the Unification War, when Milner and Helmholtz
were preparing for the final battle. Many tests were needed before they
managed to create the unique Paragons they used against Sigmund. The
Chocolate Paragon was their last failed experiment before the Opal Paragon
was created, and the only one to survive the procedures of two of the greatest
Magi in history.
