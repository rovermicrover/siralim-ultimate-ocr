In Rodia's popular culture, Spirits are considered a good omen. These
creatures are apparently scared of the bustle of big cities, so it is more frequent
to find them at night in small towns or villages.

Many people suffer from the uncertainty of not knowing what tomorrow will
bring. Clairvoyant Spirits approach them and show them illusions of happiness.
These are commonly interpreted as visions of the future, and they help people
live without fear, even if they are false.
