Sins take shape when the selfish desires of humans and other intelligent
creatures have serious consequences. These creatures are not aggressive
unless attacked, but their disturbing presence simply cannot be ignored.

On one occasion, a famous theater actor had his performance interrupted
when a Superbia Sin entered the stage. Furious and utterly embarrassed, he
grabbed a mountain of props and threw it at the creature. Impassively, the Sin
responded by covering him in (real) fire and lava.
