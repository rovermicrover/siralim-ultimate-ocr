Tartarith sometimes gets distracted while creating Abominations, and the
sukjects end up dying or becoming creatures like the Bile Abomination. The
digestive system of this creature is a time bomb that never stops creating an
extremely corrosive substance in its stomach. Eventually, it exceeds the
capacity of its body and escapes through the mouth, seriously damaging
anyone it comes into contact with.
