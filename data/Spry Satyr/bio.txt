Before creating the Blood Grove, Apocranox assembled a group of humans to
establish a colony in his realm. After drinking from the springs and eating the
fruits that grew there, these humans became Satyrs.

Due to Eft attacks, many Satyrs suffer serious injuries. Losing a limb is not
uncommon in the Blood Grove, but unlike Inquisitors, Satyrs cannot
regenerate. This does not stop these Satyrs from entering battle, adapting their
combat form so it continues to be effective.
