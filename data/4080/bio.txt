The existence of this God and the Forgotten Laboratory are linked to the
technology developed at Ubi Concordia. In fact, he is the youngest God in
existence, and still knows practically nothing about Rodia or the world in
general. He is able to understand human emotions even if he does not feel
them, but it is difficult for him, so he often asks if he has made a mistake when
it comes to evaluating them. He is not hostile to outsiders, but he does not
understand why they seem to enjoy killing each other, as he does not see the
point of risking something so fleeting and fragile in that way for a few coins.
