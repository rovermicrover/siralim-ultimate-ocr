Davey is able to absorb the mist around its neck, but only during a new moon is
it able to release it. That is why this creature has been used on occasions by
Rodians to clear roads affected by this weather condition or to perform surprise
attacks. However, a simple spell can have the same effect, so ultimately its
usefulness in battle is viewed more as a last resort or as a decoy.
