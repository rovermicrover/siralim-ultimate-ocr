Human activity, especially during wars, has caused serious damage to the
world's forests. After the Forest Priests first appeared, some Magi realized that
magic could affect nature, and even allow them to use nature in their favor.
Thus, the first Nature Magi were born.

Ancient Ents are usually harmless, but they can be merciless when their forest
is threatened, especially by humans, whom they sometimes impale on the
branch of a tree as a warning to others.
