In every group of Hunters there is always a leader, whom the scholars of
non-human societies call the Hunter Director. They are always the bravest
members of the group and masters of the shuriken, although they still need the
support of their own kind. They charge at their enemiesâ€™ front lines and throw
their shurikens while attacking with their swords. As if it were a dance, their
companions return the throwing weapon with strikes of their own, destroying
their enemies in a matter of seconds.
