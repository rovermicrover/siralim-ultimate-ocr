Though their methods are more than questionable, one of the Auditors’ goals is
to bring peace to the whole world.

Brave Little Bots are the last thing the Auditors would use when facing a threat.
They can perceive other creatures’ neural transmissions, as well as the
structure of their brains, analyze them with their extensive database, and use
the resulting information to know exactly what their target will do, all in a
fraction of a second. In addition, if they are lost and certain conditions are met,
they will self-destruct in a huge explosion.
