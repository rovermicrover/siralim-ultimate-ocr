Able to take on large groups on its own, the Skeleton Marksman walks in a
slow and cocky way towards its opponents, shooting ruthlessly in all directions.
When that is not enough to make them flee in disarray, it will skillfully slip
among any enemies that manage to approach, causing serious injuries with
well-aimed shots of its firearms. If there are survivors, it will tie them to a horse
and drag them down the road until they die.
