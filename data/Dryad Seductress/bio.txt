The Dryad Seductress is a mysterious creature whose existence is linked to an
oak in which a poet carved eight romantic verses. This creature sings a tender
melody as she approaches those who exploit the resources of nature. Her
voice produces a state of obtundation, preventing her targets from moving.
When she is in front of her victims, she raises her right hand and tears a part of
their soul, then buries it in the ground. From that moment, they entrust their
lives to the protection of nature.
