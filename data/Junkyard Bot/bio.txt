Ubi Concordia is very different from other cities, as its technology is extremely
advanced.

There are hidden places where robot fights take place. Specifically, fights
between Junkyard Bots. They were initially at the service of the Auditors, robots
conceived for the construction and maintenance of Ubi Concordia, but due to
their simple Al, more and more are hacked each day for use in illegal fights, as
escorts, or as thugs.
