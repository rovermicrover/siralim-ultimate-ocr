The Amphisbaenas' arrival was not welcomed by everyone in Omnia, as many
of them risked losing their jobs. One would think the Pilwiz would have felt
threatened as well, but this was never the case. In fact, Sigmund, aware of
what would happen if he tried to integrate these creatures into agricultural
activities, asked them to dedicate their efforts to other tasks. It was not until the
fall of Omnia that the Amphisbaena began to work the fields, but only in private
properties, or in regions the Pilwiz were unable to supply due to the distance or
weather conditions.
