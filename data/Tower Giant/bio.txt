Adult Giants vary in height between 10 and 25 feet, depending on the
subspecies and the individual, although there is one exception.

Tower Giants are among the largest, with most of them exceeding 20 feet in
height. For obvious reasons, their size is their main strength, but it is also their
weak point, as their blows are very slow, and they are an easy target for spells.
