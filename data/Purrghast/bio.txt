A legend in Undolim tells of a spirit that steals people's lives and gives them to
cats until they have nine. After the Unification War, a boy watched from his
window as a hooded figure approached and touched a drunkard who was
walking down the street. The man collapsed onto the cobblestones as a cat
came out of a trash can and started grooming its paw. The boy's terrified gaze
soon met a pair of glowing eyes in the dark. The unknown figure removed its
hood, revealing a cat's head. "Meow", said the strange being. The boy
screamed so loud he woke up his family. His parents looked at each other in
disbelief as he told the story, but when they went out to look for the man they
believed had passed out from drunkenness, they found that he was indeed
dead.
