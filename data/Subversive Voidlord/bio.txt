Given Dragan's impeccable track record, it was a shock that Laglor, his last
prcject, failed miserably. However, yet more enigmatic was what occurred
afterwards, when he disappeared from the tower, and apparently from the
whole world.

There is a limit to how many creatures a Voidlord can erase daily. This number
is usually three, though it is believed to depend on the victim's size.

The Subversive Voidlord can compress its body to appear much smaller. It
waits until it is surrounded, and when it is satisfied with the number of
attackers, it unfolds its tentacles, rising like a terrifying monster. The less
experienced fighters watch helplessly as the whirlwind of limbs oscillates in an
unpredictable and frightful way, unable to defend themselves as a tentacle
pierces their bodies.
