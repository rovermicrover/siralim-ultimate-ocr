Tremors protect the creatures that live in the forests, plains and mountains.
When they get angry, they can cause small seismic movements by placing
their hands on the ground.

The Quamar Tremor can disintegrate stone at will, and there are always rings
of sand rotating around it. This creature throws this sand at its enemiesâ€™ eyes to
blind them temporarily, preventing them from taking any action.
