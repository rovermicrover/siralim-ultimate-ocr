In the towns and cities of the Empire, the people of Kaito began to erect
temples in which to worship Sphinxes. This was apparently suggested by the
Sphinxes themselves. According to Queen-Pharach Hatesh, they rather built a
house in which to serve them food and grant their wishes. Most of these
requests were made by the Sphinx Ordainer, who, with carefully chosen words,
obtained what it wanted from humans without them suspecting that they were
being manipulated.
