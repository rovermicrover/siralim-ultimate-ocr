When this creature's mace hits the body of its enemies, the sphere of light on
its head shines strongly. Because of this, it was believed that the Sun Crusader
gained power from fighting evil. However, the truth is that they do so by letting
their mace gain kinetic energy. Unfortunately, many innocents were judged
while this was still popular belief, and they lost their lives when the face of this
creature lit up.
