Animations are the failed result of the necromantic practices of inexperienced
Magi.

The Brain Animation never attacks directly, instead using its powers to break

down the cells in their opponentsâ€™ bodies. If it is about to take damage, it uses
the same powers to harden its body and withstand blows that would normally
destroy it completely.
