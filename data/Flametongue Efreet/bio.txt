The Efreets were born from the fire and lava of the Great Pandemonium
through the work of Vulcanar and several Magi. Unlike Bjinns, these creatures
are not ambitious and never betray their owners, although they are quite
mischievous.

The Flametongue Efreet's control over fire is such that it can alter its properties,
so that instead of burning a creature it fills it with vigor and energy.
