No Wyvern flies as high as the Skystalker. Its vision allows it to spot prey at
great distances and even distinguish prey from more dangerous creatures.
When it finds one, it plummets at full speed and swerves at the last moment,
grabbing it with its claws and throwing it against a tree or a wall. It is considered
one of the fastest and most deadly hunters in Radia, although it rarely attacks
people.
