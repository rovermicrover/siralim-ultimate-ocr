If an intelligent creature attracts the attention of the Auditors, but is not invited
to the organization, it is likely they will be injected with a mysterious substance
at some point in their life.

The tasks a Living Arbiter performs are somewhat different from those of other
individuals of its species. It is usually found in the field, where research of all
kinds is carried out, advising and resolving conflicts between researchers in its
own way. Of course, anyone who tries to steal or destroy a scientific prcject will
have to deal with this creature.
