Vulcanar put a lot of effort into making the Apocalypses look imposing and
terrifying, hoping the Watchers would flee when they saw them. Although that
never happened, their help was invaluable during the war, as they were able to
attack several creatures at once and attract attention to themselves, thanks to
their size and appearance. They allowed the inhabitants of towns and cities to
escape to a safe place.
