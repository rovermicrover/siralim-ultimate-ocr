When a Demigod remains mationless, its servants have no way of knowing
whether it is resting or simply ignoring them.

The Timeless Master is extremely cruel and enjoys situations in which
someone asks to trade their life for that of a loved one. After accepting the
sacrifice, it will order its servants ta inflict a wound that will make them bleed to
death. However, before this happens, it will exchange that person's life force for
that of the one that was to be saved, laughing maliciously.
