Since the Luckmantrias arrived in Rodia, all kinds of rumors have arisen about
their luck-related powers. That is why the Rodians quickly discovered that trying
to chase them can be as dangerous as climbing to the top of a mountain during
a thunderstorm.

The wheat and corn fields of Hutika are infested with Spade Luckmantrias,
something the Uraloses are not precisely excited about. Though Luckmantrias
do not feel threatened by these beings, sometimes they could be injured by
accident, if it were not because someone forgot a harvesting instrument among
the branches that fortuitously ended up stamped on a Uralos snout.
