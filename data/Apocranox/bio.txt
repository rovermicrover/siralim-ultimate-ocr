Elinar was a forest Elf who lived for hundreds of years in the northeast
Cutthroat Jungle of a different continent. In that place, an evil empress not only
banned non-humans from using what little magic there was, but also ordered
their extermination, which caused an exodus of creatures such as Smiths and
Gorgons. The Elves, hidden in the woods, were the main foes of this Dark
Lady, the only ones who were not exterminated despite the fact that they would
not leave their home under any circumstances. Elinar was their most powerful
warrior, but the Auditors tried to recruit him before the war came to an end.
Elinar accepted the offer, but he would only join them when the war ended. The
Auditors assured him that the land of the Elves could never fall to the empress,
and that she would be betrayed by one of her own in less than a year. Still
Elinar declined the offer. The next morning, the empress was dead. According
to one of the survivors in the castle, five Carnages and a "big eye" had taken
her down after overwhelming her personal guard. For the eleven years he
worked with his five companions in the organization, Elinar used the codename
Morning Star.
