Cherubs are known on extremely rare occasions when exposed to specific
stimuli to initiate a rapid transformation, suddenly accumulating tremendous
amounts of energy before vanishing in a burst of intense light. To this date, this
has only been known to happen twice â€” once with a freezing cherub hewn of
ice, and with another sickly cherub perpetually enveloped in salty water.

The most volatile and mercurial of their kind, Chandra Cherubs often seem to
exist in synchronicity with unseen cycles and forces. Their energies change,
surging and waning, sometimes quite suddenly. While research into Cherubs is
already considered notoriously difficult, the Chandra Cherub's ceaseless
defiance of any known form of reason or reality is of infamous befuddlement to
Magi.
