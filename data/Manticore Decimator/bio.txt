The claws of the Manticores are as hard as the first metals humans used to
forge weapons. Nowadays, vervain is planted around towns and cities to keep
these creatures away.

The Manticore Decimator prefers to attack at night, when the darkness can
hide its presence. But what makes this creature especially dangerous is how it
deals with its enemies. When it fights, it completely foregoes defense, biting
and clawing at its enemies without caring about its own safety.
