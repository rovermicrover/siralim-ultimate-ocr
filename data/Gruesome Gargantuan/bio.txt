Precious minerals are a Gargantuan's favorite food, although they usually eat
all kinds of ordinary rocks. These creatures will fight for any cause if promised a
nice helping of quartz. The Watcher War ravaged many human towns and
cities, but also some settlements of other intelligent creatures that lived in the
mountains. Torun did not take this into account and the result was the
Gruesome Gargantuan. Magic acts unpredictably around it, and manifests
spontaneously to damage its enemies.
