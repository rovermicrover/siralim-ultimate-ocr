Staring intently at a Wisp allows one to see the moment of their own death for
a few seconds. Whether they are truly fate or just the mast likely future, these
visions can be deadly on their own, often provoking heart attacks.

The Abyssal Wisp usually dwells in dark marine environments. Its eyes not
only allow it to see in the dark, but they can also move freely within its body,
allowing it a full range of vision.
