Centuries ago, the Death Magi of the Magic University of Nex developed a
complex ritual that madified the structure of a Leper. The result is a creature
that can literally absorb corpses through its skin. It can slightly increase its
power in this way, provided the corpses are fresh. After a while, the skeletons
of the absorbed creatures emerge from its body and fall off.
