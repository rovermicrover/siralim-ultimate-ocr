When a necromancer creates an Animation, the rest of the body that part
belonged to turns to dust after a few seconds. In addition, the size of the body
part increases considerably.

Necromancers who bring Eye Animations to life often place them outside their
lairs to keep an eye on the horizon, as their sharp vision allows them to see any
detail within three miles.
