The jaws of a Fiend are generally over 3 feet in length. Their bite is deadly to
most creatures, and even Apacalypses or Giants are at risk of losing a limb
due to their extraordinary strength.

Unlike the rest of its kind, the Berserker Fiend does not mind taking
unnecessary risks to obtain food. This creature attacks in a straight line with all
of its strength, trying to inflict as much damage as possible without worrying
about its own injuries.
