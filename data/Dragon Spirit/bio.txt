In times of crisis, Dragons can perform a ritual that literally materializes their
faith in their own people. This extraordinary manifestation has no awareness
and only obeys very simple orders, but in battle it is a formidable ally as strong
as any other Dragon. When its services are no longer required, it disappears
like a beam of light spreading in all directions.
