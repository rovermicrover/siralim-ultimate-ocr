There are stories in the towns around the forests of Undolim about a creature
that feeds on naughty children. Long ago, a rebellious little girl decided to put
an end to that old wives' tale by entering the forest with her friends. At nightfall,
she led them down a path among the trees, waited for them to get lost and hid
herself. She would end the stories, yes, but why not give them a good scare
first? Her friends, frightened, began to call her in increasingly loud voices.
When they were just about to panic, the girl dropped from a tree and roared as
if she were a ferocious beast. Her friends turned around, but their reaction was
not what she expected. They looked pale and were paralyzed by fear, looking
in the girl's direction but not at her. Her heart sank as she slowly turned around
and met the ghostly eyes of the Tanukrook.
