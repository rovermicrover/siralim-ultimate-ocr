It took half of the Raven population of Crux to build a new home for the
Carbuncles. When the ritual began, trails of light quickly shot into the air over
the squawks and arcane movements that guided the magic towards its
manifestation. But Vertraag had not revealed the price they would pay. When
the door to the new world opened at the top of the city's magic palace, the
Ravens who had participated in its creation lost their lives and collapsed on the
cobblestones of their own home. A few, perhaps fortunately, managed to see
the Carbuncles start their long journey before closing their eyes forever.

The Sapphire Carbuncle appeared after that and stayed with the Ravens,
guarding the Rod of Ruin for thousands of years. However, now that the
Temple of Lies is accessible, it has joined its kind to protect their lives.
