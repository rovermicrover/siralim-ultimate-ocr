Many mistake Tisya for a Goddess, although in truth she is closely linked to
them. Surathli and Erebyss created her shortly after the world's first cities were
established, so that mortals could have an absolutely impartial and otjective
opinion to settle their conflicts. Her word is indisputable in every kingdom, but
with the passage of centuries she began to ask for increasingly higher prices
for her services, until, at present, hearing her verdict is a privilege very few can
afford.
