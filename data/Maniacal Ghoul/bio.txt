Ghouls are undead creatures that have lost their minds. During the siege of
Omnia, the civilians and soldiers of the defending forces were attacked by their
own companions, friends and loved ones when they died in the bloody battle.

The bite of a Maniacal Ghoul is usually deadly, as once he clings to a victim he
never lets it go unless his head and limbs are destroyed first.
