Dikya is an enthusiastic, inquisitive creature that devotes its life to scientific
research. However, it refuses to document its discoveries and only shares
them in exchange for any type of information that is not yet part of its vast
knowledge. Like some of the Gods, it can see what is happening anywhere
without being physically present, a skill that has made it the most renowned
informant in history. For this reason, Dikya is constantly being persecuted and
has been kidnapped countless times since it mysteriously appeared thousands
of years ago. However, these kidnappings usually do not last more than a few
days, as it is one of the greatest assets of the Auditors.
