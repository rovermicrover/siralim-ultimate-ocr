The Frozen Spirit is almost as old as Azural. When the Magi of Sithicus began
to investigate the Frostbite Caverns, this creature appeared. Many lost
travelers and explorers found their way when they were lucky enough to find it.
When someone tends to the wounds of an ally, this creature can turn the
healing magic into a thick layer of ice that protects against blows.
