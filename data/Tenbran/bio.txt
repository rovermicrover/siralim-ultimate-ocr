Perdition created this creature at a time when he sorely missed his beloved
sister. Without intending it, Tenbran reflects in its face the state of mind in
which the God of Limbo is at that moment. They became very good friends and
debated on countless topics over the years. Upon the arrival of his sister
Sevalah, she looked at the creature with a raised eyebrow. "I see you have
missed me, little brother," she said. Perdition smiled and hugged her tightly
while Tenbran watched the scene with its face filled with a sorrow not its own.
