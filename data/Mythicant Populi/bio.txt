The Mythicants took shapes related to the three novels based on the diaries an
Andolian soldier wrote during the Unification War. Anyone in possession of one
of its pages can control a Mythicant.

The Mythicant Populi uses its book and blade to protect itself from enemy
attacks. Unlike other Mythicants, it materializes words outside of battle that
float above its head and describe what it is doing at all times.
