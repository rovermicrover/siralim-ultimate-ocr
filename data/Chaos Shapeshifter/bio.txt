Shapeshifters live in small tribes, deep in the Swamplands and the Unsullied
Meadows. To protect themselves from their enemies, these creatures alter
their structure and copy that of other creatures.

Chaos Shapeshifters are the rowdiest of their kind. Some do not even choose
their path voluntarily, but they end up transforming into that class of creatures
simply because of their unbridled character.
