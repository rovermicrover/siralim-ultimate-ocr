The movements of an Abomination's bady are controlled by the main head.
However, the task of casting spells falls to the secondary head, and sometimes
they find it hard to agree on what to do during battle.

Free Ritual Abominations often gather in the Unsullied Meadows to gaze at the
stars in silence. During that time, they have access to each other's minds and
share their thoughts of peace and serenity.
