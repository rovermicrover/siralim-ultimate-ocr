This creature usually flies low, moving with great skill through trees and other
obstacles in search of small herbivores and other harmless creatures to hunt.
Its scream is inaudible to most creatures due to its high frequency. However, it
is useful to stun some of its prey. Moreover, the sound it emits has magical
qualities and can return some spells to their casters.
