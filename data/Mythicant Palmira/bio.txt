Mythicants were born in Andolin due to an unfortunate ritual, as well as the
magic contained in several novels based on the struggles of an Andolian
soldier during the Unification War.

The sword of the Mythicant Palmira turns to ash as soon as it stops holding the
handle. When this happens, it can create a new one by simply touching
another pile of ash.
