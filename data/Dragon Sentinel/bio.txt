The Dragonsâ€™ mating season occurs during the summer solstice, when
hundreds of them can be seen intertwining in mid-air and looping in a majestic
dance of beauty and mystery.

Dragon Sentinels are the watchmen of the Unsullied Meadows, and are always
in contact with Ents, Moss Golems, and other creatures that protect nature,
which update them on what is happening in the vast Meadows. Their tracking
ability and their acute sense of smell mean not a single infraction escapes their
notice.
