Fools (as a trade) are common in the courts of monarchs. Bard Fools,
however, are quite rare. There was once a jester in Gangrel of great wit and
daring. His sharp and cunning tongue was unparalleled in court, but he became
seriously ill and was on the verge of death. The queen did not want to lose him,
and had some Magi find a way to save his life. And they did so, in their own
way. This creature makes people laugh like nobody else, but it also brings out
their flaws and their darkest secrets.
