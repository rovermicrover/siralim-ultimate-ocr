This creature's presence ensures the gestation cycle of the other aspects
remains active. In addition, it is capable of altering the weather, turning even a
light drizzle into hail. It was created thousands of years ago by six powerful
Nature Magi when the increased use of magic began to affect the cycle of the
seasons. That is why Aspects are destined to confront any spellcasters they
come across.
