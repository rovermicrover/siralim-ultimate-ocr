The Skull Devil can make flowers wither or slowly extinguish a person's life. But
it does not always have such patience. Skull Devils need to reap at least one
life every day or they become dust, but, as they are banned from all the cities in
Rodia, they wait in areas where merchant caravans usually camp for the night.
When a group of travelers arrives, the Devil comes out of the shadows and
uses its scythe to cut off the head of any traveler who wanders off from the
group.
