The existence of the Nihilists is believed to be linked to that of the Voidlords. In
fact, there are those who think these creatures exist only to end them.

When a Nihilist Protector places its hand on its book and chants, all creatures
within a mile of it are shielded from the Voidlords' powers for thirty-six days.
