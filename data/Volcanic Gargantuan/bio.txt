The Volcanic Gargantuan is one the world's greatest potential natural disasters,
for obvious reasons. When Torun took the liberty of giving life to several
volcanoes, Surathli and Azural gave him a goad scolding. Vertraag also went to
the Cutthroat Jungle, if only to enjoy the show. After a long discussion, Torun
reluctantly made it so that these creatures would only be able to eject very hot
rocks, which is still highly dangerous. Luckily, the creatures can only be found
in volcanic areas.
