The scientist who sold the Automaton blueprints has already been arrested by
the authorities, but the clandestine factories, some of which mass-produced
these creatures, were in operation for too long.

like him. When the kingdom's authorities came to question him, he was
accompanied by a Luxury Automaton who had a face similar to his, and the
same moustache. The tycoon denied knowing anything about the matter and
pointed at the Automaton, saying "I don't really see the resemblance‚Äù, which
was not very convincing.
