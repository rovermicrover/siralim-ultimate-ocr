Even today, when a group of Asura goes on the attack, they usually take a few
Warhogs with them.

The Dire Warhog is at its most dangerous when it charges, as orcs often equip
blades on their tusks that can easily pierce through armor. These creatures
move in their sleep much more often than any other Warhaog, at times even
getting up and unceremoniously ramming everything around them.
