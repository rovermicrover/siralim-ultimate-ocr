Kaito was razed to the ground by the Watchers thousands of years before the
Seraphs existed. Gonfurian claimed the ruins of that kingdom, and they
became part of his realm. When the Unification War came to an end, many
Seraphs of the newly founded Rodia had lost their wings and ability to
reproduce due to the fall of the kingdoms they served, or rather, those they
were forced to serve. However, a group of these homeless Seraphs came to
Surathli and asked for mercy. The Goddess pondered for a moment and
decided to give them back their ability to spawn new Seraphs, uniting them all
into one single lineage. These Seraphs all took different paths, but they always
used their new blade to carry out the designs of the forces of good. Some of
them began to protect the ruins of Kaito from looters. Given the great cultural
value of those ruins, archeologists and historians began calling these creatures
"Keepers of Knowledge", or even "Kaito Seraphs", as they are commonly
known today.
