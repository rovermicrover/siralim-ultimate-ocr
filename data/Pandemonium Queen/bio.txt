This creature is a manifestation of Vulcanar's sense of humor, poured into his
Pandemonium Tokens in the form of a floating fortress that spits fire and
blazing rocks. Although harmless to most civilians, it can wreak havoc when
summoned in the middle of nature, even when it simply opens its mouth to
insult whoever summoned it. Specifically, Vulcanar thought it would be hilarious
if an adventurer made it appear in the middle of the Cutthroat Jungle to set the
trees on fire and make Torun mad.
