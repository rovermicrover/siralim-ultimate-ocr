Vertraag got the inspiration to create the Pit Wraiths after meeting Regalis's
Mite Paralyzer. He used the Transient Spectre, whose existence is
compressed in time, as a blueprint. These creatures possess very diverse
temporal abilities, and their presence is disturbing, perhaps solely due to their
appearance.

When the claws of a Pit Wraith Dominator tear the skin of an enemy, the flow
of time around the wound is accelerated, which makes the blood flow three
times faster.
