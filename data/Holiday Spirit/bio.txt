Holiday Spirits have no color or shine for most of the year and can be mistaken
for a suspicious-looking bush. During the winter festivities, however, they regain
their vitality and quickly travel to the nearest town or village, no matter how
densely populated. There they fly among the crowd, wearing a permanent
smile. Rodians greatly enjoy the display when many of these creatures gather.
