The Unicorn Holycaster's commitment to the fight against evil is absolute and it
is always on the move, looking for twisted creatures to execute. When one
grows up, the matriarch of its drove draws a cross with her horn on the back of
the aspiring new warrior. If it cannot stand the pain, it means it was not ready
and must wait another year to try again. Not being able to be marked after five
attempts or giving up the crusade is considered a disgrace in its culture and
punished with exile.
