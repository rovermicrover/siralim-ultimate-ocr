During the Siege of Caedo, King Misery announced that one citizen would be
killed every minute unless Undolim withdrew its forces. Taking advantage of
the fact that mast of the knights were on the walls, a very angry Crystal Smith
headbutted one and stole his weapon. A riot had begun. The Smiths quickly
ascended the castle with him at the helm, until they reached the throne room.
There, the Smith fought in single combat against King Misery and ended his
life, which earned him Gonfurian's favor.
