Pit Worms are typically between six and ten feet in length. For some reason,
most of them live far from population centers and trade routes. There are two
theories in this regard: either intelligent creatures built their settlements based
on the number of attacks by these creatures, or the Pit Worms somehow
learned that the inhabitants of the surface are usually more dangerous than
them.

The Spitting Pit Worm's saliva goes directly to the bloodstream, causing
nausea and intestinal irritation.
