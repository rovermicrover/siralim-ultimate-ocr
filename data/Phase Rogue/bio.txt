The Queen was running out of time. While the Phase Warriors invaded Omnia
with Vanelin's and Andolin's forces, she appeared at the gates of Sigmund's
castle and challenged him to single combat. The Queen lost her life but took
half of the dark lord's jaw with her.

During the siege of Siralim, a renowned criminal helped the royal guard protect
the prince. He was the last one standing and managed to escape Sigmund with
the child in his arms. But his shoulder had been pierced by a poisoned arrow.
