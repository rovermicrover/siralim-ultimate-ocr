The wealthy people in the great cities generally have a Bard in their mansions,
who they keep in the basement until its presence is required.

The poems of the Bard Versifier speak of nature, of the singing of birds, green
on green, the wind whispering through the leaves of the trees. Its verses push
even the busiest people to abandon their chores and take a day off away from
the bustle of the city.
