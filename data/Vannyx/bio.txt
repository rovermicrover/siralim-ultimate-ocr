These creatures have long been collaborating with humans and other intelligent
creatures. It all started when their ability to predict earth movements was
discovered. No more than a decade passed before the Vannyx found
themselves in the mines alongside the Rodians, preventing casualties when
there was a collapse. In return, they are fed the entrails of all kinds of animals,
especially those that are hard to sell on the market. If threatened, they quickly
dig a tunnel underground and sneak away at breakneck speed.
