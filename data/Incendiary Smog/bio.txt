This creature continuously expels fire, and can produce flames of up to fifteen
feet in length. If surrounded, it spins rapidly and blasts fire at full power to drive
its enemies away. It prefers to wander through dry places where vegetation is
scarce. Although this is fortunate for Rodia's forests and crops, Incendiary
Smogs attack merchant caravans even when they are at a disadvantage,
generally causing substantial losses before being subdued if not detected early.
