It is rare to see a Shade near towns or cities, since they are greatly disturbed
by the presence of souls, except those that were tainted by their previous
selves.

Gateway Shades come from creatures that used magic at some point of their
lives. When they feel threatened, they create a small spatial distortion to
teleport behind their enemies and attack them by surprise.
