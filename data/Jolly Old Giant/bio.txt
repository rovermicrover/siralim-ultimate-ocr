It was a winter morning when the Watcher Sentinel finally bit the dust
thousands of years ago. The bloody war had ended, and that day became part
of the world's history, to be celebrated every year. The Gods had gathered in
the battlefield, and Vulcanar raised his finger to the sky and fired a spell to
create a colorful lightshow that thrilled the survivors. Torun, enraged, decided to
create a Giant that would travel to towns and cities delivering gifts on that day
‘without expecting anything in return”, because, although mortals were
insignificant creatures, he wouldn't let them favor his archrival over him.
