Mount Hyvana was the site of one of the first battles of the Unification War.
Vanelin's army wiped out the enemy in a matter of minutes, literally reducing
them to ashes and severed limbs. After the victory of the Vanelites, they
ordered the bodies to be buried. When the war ended, the daughter of one of
these soldiers used the residual magic from the battle to cast a powerful spell
meant to bring the dead back to life.
