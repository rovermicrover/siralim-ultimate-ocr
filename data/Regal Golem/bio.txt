This Golem's purpose is to protect the lives of its allies at any cost. Although, in
theory, they should not have feelings or a conscience, they have been known to
smile after assisting someone in need. According to a Mage's account from a
few decades ago, her Regal Golem showed reluctance to leave a village they
were passing through. The following night, the village was attacked by a Carver
Shadowstalker that murdered the entire population.
