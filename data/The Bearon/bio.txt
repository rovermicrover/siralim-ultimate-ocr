There is a forest near the northern edge of the Bronze Sea where a most
unusual species of bears lives. They are intelligent, although they do not
communicate with words but with gestures and grunts. Most live in cozy
wooden houses and wear monacles and hats. When a house is left uninhabited
for a while, they reuse its wood to build again. Although they never leave the
forest in which they live, they have several clearings to which they go twice a
week to trade goods with outsiders and other Bearons.
