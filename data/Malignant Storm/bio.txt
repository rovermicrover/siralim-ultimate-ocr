On a sunny spring day, Helmholtz and Milner were scouring the Unsullied
Meadows in search of a Nether Orb. At some point, the Hurricane and the
Storm Lord that were their respective companions began to compete,
discharging water and electricity in all directions. Their energy eventually
condensed, and the Nether Orb they were seeking started a reaction that fused
the two Storms into the Malignant. This Storm rains harder, contains more
electricity, and curses more frequently than any other.
