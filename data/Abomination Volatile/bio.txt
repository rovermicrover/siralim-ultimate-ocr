Tartarith created the Abominations to protect the Torture Chamber, but he
eventually decided that it would be more fun to set them free and let them sow

The Abomination Volatile despises violence, and it prefers to grab its enemies
and throw them far away so that they stop hurting it. Naturally, this has ended
many lives.
