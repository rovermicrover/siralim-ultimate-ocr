Thanks to advances in magic, a group of Neralim scientisis succeeded in
creating a functional design of the unfinished prototype. Automatons were built
to protect Rodia. They are mindless soldiers who only obey orders from their
owners.

The Arcane Automaton is unable to handle weapons with its hands, but it can
telepathically move the crystals that orbit around it to cut its enemies down. If
one of the crystals breaks, it uses the tears that come from its eye to make
another.
