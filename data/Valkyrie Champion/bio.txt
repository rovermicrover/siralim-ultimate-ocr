The city of Omnia had advanced technology that even allowed its inhabitants to
sail the skies in large airships. After Sigmund cast his Spectre curse, the
Valkyries of various kingdoms began to gather without anyone noticing.

Valkyrie Champions are fast and reckless warriors who charge through their
enemiesâ€™ spells, cutting them down with their twin swords. The "Dance of the
Valkyries" ended when the Champions gave their lives to destroy the engines
of the enemy ships.
