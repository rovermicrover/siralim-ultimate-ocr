These creatures only live in the high mountains where freezing winds blow
without pause. However, they travel to snow-covered towns and cities during
the winter and slide around the ground, leaving a trail of ice that Brownies and
children from many species use as a skating rink. They do not usually cause
problems, so adults let their children play with them, but they get restless if they
are forced to remain in a warm location, producing hail and cursing while
moving around in a frenzy.
