Adter their uprising in the Refuge of the Magi, the Djinns noticed this creature in
the chamber where the Djinn Ghula had been created. They decided to destroy
it, but not only was their magic harmless to it, it also made it mutate with each
spell thrown at it. The Infested Slime was grateful for the spells and returned
the favor by also casting some at the Bjinns. It was not long before it grew
bored of the fleeing Bjinns and decided to leave the tower and see the world.
