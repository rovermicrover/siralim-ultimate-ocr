Walken was King Taylor's personal executioner thousands of years ago.
Shortly before the violent end to his reign, Walken became seriously ill and was
on the verge of death. However, Taylor appreciated his work and decided that
he would not allow a mere illness to rob him of his services: not even death
could be an excuse to quit his job. When Taylor's father, Tartarith, became a
God and murdered him, Walken was released and began to roam the world
with no purpose... until the Auditors recruited him as the executor of their plans.
Specifically, those that include the words "tie loose ends" and always end with
a head rolling on the ground.
