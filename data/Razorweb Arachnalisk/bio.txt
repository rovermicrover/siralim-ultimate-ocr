Some Arachnalisks are capable of producing a very hard web, as sharp as a
knife or a sword. They are known as Razorweb Arachnalisks, and instead of
attacking their enemies with their claws or fangs, they do so with their own
special webs, although they cannot weave them in large quantities. These
weapons can be thrown as if they were spears, as well as serving as a melee
weapon.
