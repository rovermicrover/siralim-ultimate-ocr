Ubi Concordia, the hidden city from which the Auditors operate, is a utopia
where everyone can live in peace and harmony.

One of the most controversial scientific prcjects in Ubi Concordia aimed to
extend a creature's lifespan through technology and magic. The result was
disastrous, given the agony that living in a cold metal body meant for the
sukject, so it was abandoned until a terrorist group managed to get their hands
on the files. Today, Bio Bots are pawns who obey orders without question, on
the promise that they will be given back their old bodies if they do everything
they are told.
