This creature is not really a Masochist, but an automaton at the service of the
Auditors. If intruders were to sneak into the city of Ubi Concordia, the
Masochist Freak would run its attack program to end their lives. This creature's
plasma katars can pierce flesh and bone with ease, but their energy is limited.
When the energy is exhausted, it can put its arms into an organic body and
absorb its entrails until it is completely empty. Inside the Masochist Freak, a
chemical process will take place that transforms these organs into fuel.
