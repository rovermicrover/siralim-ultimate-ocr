Gargantuans are generally placid and peaceful, though they are fond of
parsimoniously insulting any travelers they encounter. If one has had a bad
day, it may even throw a "little" dirt on them.

When a Sturdy Gargantuan is hit by a weapon, it begins to crack, but the earth
and rock that make up its body do not come off immediately. In this way, it is
possible for an enemy to be intimidated by the hardness of its body and flee a
battle that could have been won.
