The Ugat are elementals constructed by Torun's raw anger. Although they're
not quite so indignant that they talk in all capital letters and spout obscenities at
even the mast noble of adventurers, their quick temper is out-ranked only by
their creator. This makes the Ugat a terrifying foe to behold, especially when
encountered in hordes.
