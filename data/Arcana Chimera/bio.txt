The Chimeras were created by T'mere M'rgo for the sole purpose of protecting
the Amalgam Gardens.

The Arcana Chimera is the most intelligent of its kind, although military strategy
is better suited to one of its siblings. It prefers not to fight physically, but when
cornered it uses its stinger to keep enemies away. Only if this does not work
will it lower its head and charge towards its enemies, possibly knocking them
out. In its spare time it loves to read, especially plays. Indeed, some these
creatures have recently visited Rodia's theaters.
