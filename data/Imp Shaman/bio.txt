Imps love crab helmets as much as any other otject that their next-door
neighbors hold in greater numbers than them. Luckily, their memory is quite

Imp Shamans are the undisputed leaders of the larger Imp communities. They
know their people very well and act as spiritual guides and confidants, as they
are the most capable of resolving the usual conflicts that occur among these
creatures.
