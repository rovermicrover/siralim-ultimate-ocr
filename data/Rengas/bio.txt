Rengas is often considered the little brother of Genaros, but he is really his first
and only son, the only creature the God of Strife has ever given life to. He is
good-natured and, unlike his father, does not get carried away with anger
easily. He helps travelers in distress by guiding them to safe places or pointing
out where they can find something to eat, but if he discovers that their
intentions are looting or indiscriminate violence he will charge with all of his
strength without a second thought.
