Whenever there is a flood or some other natural disaster, Ents act to help
animals in danger and prevent the most fragile trees from breaking due to
extreme weather.

The Hemlock Ent traps defenseless animals during these events and hides
them inside its mouth or among its branches to prevent them from dying or
getting injured.
