Wisps have been known to take control of fresh corpses. When this happens,
the eyes of the lifeless body turn blue, and it moves to undertake bloody
revenge on those who aggrieved it in life. If the possessed body successfully
takes a life in the name of revenge, it dances on the corpse before moving on
to the next victim.

There are reports of Rift Dancers interacting with these creatures. Dancing
Wisps often reject them abruptly and look away, though they always end up
playing together in the end.
