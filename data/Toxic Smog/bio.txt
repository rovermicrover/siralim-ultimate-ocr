The leader of the Spark plant was the prcject manager, a Mage who
overestimated her achievements and gave the go-ahead to the results without
performing the relevant safety checks, falsifying a series of reports. On the day
of the explosion, she was supervising the work of the operators. When the
machine failed, and everything blew up, she became the Toxic Smog. Since
then, her only concern has been to annihilate every Smog, as she would not
have been in the plant if not for their incompetence.
