Nephilim are drawn to good intentions and pure hearts. They seek to subdue
them and turn them to ashes. The Nephilim Scion's powers allow it to confuse
the thoughts of anyone within reach, sowing doubt about the intentions of
others towards them. Recently, one of these creatures appeared in the village
of Hutika and quietly passed through as its inhabitants went about their work.
That night, the village had turned into smoking rubble, and every Uralos in it
had become a soot-covered corpse.
