In the past, these creatures were harmless little furballs that preyed on insects.
Obviously, these insects would disagree with the previous sentence, but Snow
Lilies won the hearts of some species such as humans, especially in the
summer, when certain pests would ruin crops and bother people at night. Over
time they evolved and some were domesticated, although they were never
thought of as warriors to lead into battle. However, the Brownie Rebellion
changed their fate. Many of them, loyal to these creatures, supported and
fought alongside them tooth and nail, proving from that moment that they
should not be taken lightly.
