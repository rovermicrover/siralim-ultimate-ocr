Wyverns are ferocious predators that play an important role in many
ecosystems. However, Wyvern Airslayers pose a problem for these
ecosystems, as they kill other creatures for pleasure instead of necessity.
There was once a Wyvern Windrider who went into the Torture Chamber and
made the mistake of facing Tartarith. The God of Punishment easily subdued
the creature and played with it for several days, corrupting its nature until it
became the first Airslayer.
