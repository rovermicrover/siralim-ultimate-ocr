Wind Salamanders can rise in the air and travel great distances without
touching the ground. These creatures did not appear with the rest of the
Salamanders. They were born from the eggs of other breeds of Salamander
due to a mutation. A group of Salamanders that includes one of these
creatures is twice as dangerous, as they can greatly boost the abilities of their
kind. A few months ago, a team from the University of Natural Science in
Vanelin discovered that Wind Salamanders are sterile.
