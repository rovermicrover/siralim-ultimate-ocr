This being is fascinated by the creatures that inhabit Rodia and the rest of the
world. Chances are, if it meets a stranger, it will want to have a long
conversation and bombard them with questions. The life of non-intelligent
animals is especially interesting to it and currently it is dedicated to traveling
through the different ecosystems outside the Land of Breath and Balance,
contemplating the varied and abundant wildlife that proliferates there. Unlike
Ariamaki, it does not care about balance and is of the opinion that this God
should take a break from his endless crusade.
