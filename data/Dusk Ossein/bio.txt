Mortem carved these terrifying creatures out of the bone of the Titan, and to
give them life he used his own hair, putting it inside each of their jaws. Their
bodies seem to be impervious to damage, but they collapse like any other
creature after receiving enough hits. The Dusk Ossein, in fact, constantly
behaves as if it had been defeated. It camouflages itself in the ground, and it
can be mistaken for a bunch of rocks which color varies depending on where it
is. This fact is also used as proof by those who believe the Ossein have a
certain degree of consciousness.
