The physical development of Imlers is extraordinarily fast, and they can reach a
maximum height of 10 feet. Their powerful hands allow them to dig and break
through rock easily.

Iron Imlers are the fiercest of their kind, and they are usually in charge of
dealing with any matter that requires their 100-pound arms. This, of course,
includes the protection of their people, although there is always at least one
Imling with them to make sure they do not get overly violent.
