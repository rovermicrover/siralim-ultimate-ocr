Mutated Crypt Bats have developed intelligence due to prolonged exposure to
magic. They are also known as "windfangs" in many places because of their
ability to fly at extraordinary speeds, and they are capable of tearing off large
chunks of flesh from their prey before it even notices anything is wrong.
