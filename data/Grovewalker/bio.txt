A greedy, unscrupulous businessman from Siralim hired the services of a
Death Mage a few months ago to corrupt some creatures who were protecting
a forest to the south. The result was the Grovewalker, a fiendish being who
wanders without conscience, withering everything it touches, spreading disease
wherever it goes. The businessman and the Death Mage were caught and
imprisoned, and work is currently under way to eliminate these creatures from
the ecosystem, with satisfactory results.
