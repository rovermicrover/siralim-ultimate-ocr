Contrary to popular belief, most Waspids are not aggressive and only attack in
self-defense. In fact, like wasps, they are the natural predators of other
creatures that harm agricultural activities.

When Waspids detect the presence of another hive near their territory, a fierce
battle for resources begins. Waspid Infiltrators are extremely fast, and they wait
for the bulk of the army to get all the attention before quickly entering the
enemy hive and assassinating the queen.
