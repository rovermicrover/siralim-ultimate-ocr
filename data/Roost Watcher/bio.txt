This creature specializes in sneaking into mansions and castles at night. It
wanders around the corridors, waiting for someone to get up for a visit to the
pantry or to empty the bladder. It uses its knowledge of light to cast a long
shadow on the ground, scaring anyone who sees it. When they are terrified
enough to ignite a stronger light, it suddenly appears in front of them with its
characteristic smile and attacks with a powerful spell.
