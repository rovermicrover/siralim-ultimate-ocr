It would take thousands of years for Brownies to reintegrate into human cities.
However, they no longer clean or cook for others, and they rely solely on
themselves. Although most of them have normal jobs in the city, some cthers,
like the Brownie Trickster, are involved in illegal activities such as robbery and
smuggling. They like to enter dens of ill repute and hit drunkards on their feet to
make them think it was someone else, starting a tavern brawl.
