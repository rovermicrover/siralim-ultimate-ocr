Most Pit Worms live underground for the majority of their lives, feeding on roots
and subterranean creatures. When they feel vibrations coming from the
surface, they emerge for a moment to surprise whatever is producing them and
eat it... or die trying.

The Pit Worm Tunneler has caused the collapse of many Rodian mines, which
has forced the authorities to implement a protocol to deal with the problem,
employing their own Tunnelers to monitor the underground perimeter.
