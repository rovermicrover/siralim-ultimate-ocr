When an old ruler of Siralim began the conquest of Radia, llberd advised the
King of Nex to propose to the Council of Sovereigns the construction of
automatons designed to defend the country. The prcject was named MK.

The Redsteel Construct can easily detach parts of its body and forge weapons
of acceptable quality in a matter of seconds. This allows civilians and soldiers
to arm themselves quickly if they have lost their weapon or do not have one. It
can restore the missing parts of its body simply by getting close to red-hot steel.
