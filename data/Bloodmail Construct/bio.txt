The average battery life of a Construct has been estimated to be 1000 days,
which is when the battery has lost too much charge and the creature stops
moving permanently. The batteries cannot be replaced, so the construct must
be discarded, although the material of which its body is made can be reused.

The Bloodmail Construct was created with the main purpose of preventing
civilians and soldiers from bleeding to death. At a touch of its armor, the blood
is partially returned to the circulatory system, giving the doctors more options to
save their life.
