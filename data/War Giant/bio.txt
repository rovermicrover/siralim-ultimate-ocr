While this creature is not really a giant, it is programmed to speak like one of
them. Like other robots created by the Auditors, it has the order to exterminate
any outsider who manages to enter Ubi Concordia. In addition to its
extraordinary strength, the War Giant possesses a plasma cannon with
devastating firepower. The more it charges its shot, the further the explosion
will reach, and the stronger it will be.
