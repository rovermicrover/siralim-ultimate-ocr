Chimeras are known to give off an unbearable smell. Each breed of Chimera
smells differently, but the Wylder Chimera takes the cake. Its smell is so
nauseating that a crime syndicate recently captured one of them to use it as a
method of torture. In battle it uses its bow and arrows, and the scythe on its left
arm can inflict lethal wounds if an enemy gets too close.
