Although the Revenants have always been at war with each other, there is a
sacred code that applies to all of them, and a council that punishes the infidels.

and other creatures of the surface, Dagon emerged from the depths to punish
them. With a simple glance of this creature, their bodies began to experience
drastic changes. They grew legs, their scales became skin, and they were
completely transformed into humans.
