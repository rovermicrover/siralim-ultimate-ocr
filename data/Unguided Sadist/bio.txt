As is the case with Angels, the only way to stop an Unguided from killing
indiscriminately is for a Mage to establish a bond with it, though one still needs
to be careful with it afterwards.

Killing is not enough for the Unguided Sadist, nor is any other punishment that
does not involve physical pain. These creatures were the first in history to
employ torture creatively. Erebyss and Surathli were upset as they watched
humans follow their example, to which Gonfurian had to say, "Don't worry, you
have only hastened the inevitable".
