In the forests of Yarthe lives an intelligent species, fully integrated into its
ecosystem. Even as children, they interact with all the creatures who live there,
establishing bonds through play, and caring for them when needed. When they
reach adulthood, they are able to summon them wherever they go, and they
will fight with them regardless of the danger involved in doing so.
