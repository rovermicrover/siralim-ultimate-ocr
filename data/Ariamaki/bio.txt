Nobody knows for sure when or how Ariamaki appeared, as his realm was
discovered by the Magic University of Neralim a few months ago. For the God
of Balance, good and evil, and chaos and order must coexist for the world to
function properly. However, his attempts to create balance are not always very
successful, and he sometimes ends up helping to commit real atrocities that he
later deeply regrets. Also, his way of dealing with people is chaotic, as he
refuses to be nice as well as unfriendly to the same person all the time.
