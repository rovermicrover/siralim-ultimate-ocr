Before Azural forged his current weapon, the mighty Wintermaul, he wielded
shields in each hand: one called Rhylthar and the other known as Kalasag,
otherwise known as the Brother Shields. Many years ago, Rhylthar was stolen
by a lieutenant of one of the first rulers of Siralim to use it as a catalyst for a
powerful spell. In response, Azural cast an enchantment on Kalasag, breathing
life into it and entrusting it with exacting vengeance on the king's man of old
and recover what was his. However, the lieutenant never went back home, and
Kalasag still seeks to fulfill its purpose to this day.
