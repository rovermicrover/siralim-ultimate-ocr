When a Snaptrap devours a creature, it stores residual energy of the creature,
along with part of its memories, inside it to feed.

From the time they sprout to the moment of their death, Parasitic Snaptraps
have a host, which changes depending on their life cycle. They first sprout
inside a small rodent, and within a few weeks they switch to a larger bird or
mammal. It does not kill these hosts, although it does shorten their lives
significantly. When it reaches maturity, the creature digs its roots into other
plants and sucks them dry. On the contrary, even though it does feed on
insects that enter its jaws, it will only attack and devour other creatures if it has
no other choice.
