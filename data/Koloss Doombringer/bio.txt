Kolosses can forge other intelligent weapons out of certain materials found in
Sanctum Umbra. However, this is a slow and complex pracess, so not all
Kolosses can give life to others.

The Koloss Doombringer is the only one of its species that really needs an eye
to see. This happens when an error is made during the forging or the
conception of a new Koloss, and a permanent full prcjection is forced on the
creature to prevent the flourishing consciousness from being destroyed.
