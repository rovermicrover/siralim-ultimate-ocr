Wyverns are known for their daring. Among them, the Windrider is the most
reckless by far. They are brave warriors, though some call them foolish, who
face any foe if it looks edible. They rarely come down to the surface, so their
diet is made up of all kinds of birds, including Griffons and Sphinxes. They are
not aware of the dangers that lurk on the ground, so Wyvern Windriders often
make deadly mistakes when choosing "prey" that is not flying.
