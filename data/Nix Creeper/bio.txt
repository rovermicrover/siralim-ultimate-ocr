The Nixes are an intelligent species that lives in underground cities. At present,
they are not at war with any other.

Some Nixes are known to leave no trace after a murder. In the surface lands
they are called Nix Creepers. They can sneak into well-protected mansions,
bypassing any security in the gardens and corridors without being discovered.
The next morning, everything will remain intact except for their target, which will
have become a corpse.
