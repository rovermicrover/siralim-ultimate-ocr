When they reach a certain age, Phoenixes can decide to burst into flames.
They emerge from the ashes as chicks that retain the memories of their
previous life.

The Ancestral Phoenix has direct control over the lives of other creatures. For a
brief moment, it can transfer its ability to resurrect through any of its spells.
Centuries ago, a famous Mage caught one of these creatures in an attempt to
resurrect her lover. However, its ability, like many others, only works for the
recently deceased.
