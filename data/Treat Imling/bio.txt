Two hundred years ago, an Imling scientist tried to prove that it is possible to
resurrect the dead even after a few minutes have passed. With great care and
skill, she reconstructed the body of an Imler and managed to make it move, but
she soon understood that her creation was completely mindless. Far from
giving up, she decided that her machine, at least, would follow her orders. After
establishing a mental link with the core of the system that allowed the Imler to
move, she presented it to the public. Her work was poorly received, and she
was exiled. The Imlings finally accepted her contribution years later, though she
died of old age shortly after that. At present, some scientists of this species
specialize in creating these beings and are known as Treat Imlings.
