Automatons began to be mass-produced some time ago in a factory in Neralim
to supply the armies of the different kingdoms of Radia, but clandestine
factories quickly began producing them as well.

When an Automaton loses its master, it walks erratically and does not attack
anyone unless it is threatened.

The blades on the Cursed Automaton's hands do not cause physical injuries,
instead draining energy from their enemies. Anyone who is attacked by them
will also experience very vivid nightmares for three days.
