After Zonte's ascension to godhood, the Itherian situation became a real threat
to the world, so the Auditors chose six agents to solve this problem. Their
codenames were Dawn, Twilight, Midnight, Morning Star, Eve, and Gloom.
Elinar was Morning Star before he was known as Apocranox.

their webs both in their underground passages and the aboveground forests.
Satyrs often pay them to protect their homes from Etts.
