The origin of Manticores can be traced back to an ancient rivalry between
humans and Nixes. The first human civilizations trembled at the brutality of
these creatures, but they endured. The last vestige of that frightful battle is the
Prowling Manticore, an immortal creature that still embodies one of the
greatest fears of mankind. It is almost seven feet tall, and its bite can easily
tear a person's head off, and it has a dangerous ability to travel between
realms and appear where it sees fit.
