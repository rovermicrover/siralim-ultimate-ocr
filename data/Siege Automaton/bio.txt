A pitched battle between two mafias devastated Irizen, a town in Andolin. By
the time the authorities arrived in what was left of it, they found only the
criminalsâ€™ bodies and hundreds of civilian casualties.

A group of Skeletons managed to get ahold of the Automaton blueprints and
built Siege Automatons to assist them in their skirmishes. Their shots can go
through walls even at long distances if they are charged for a minute before

firing. In addition, they can release highly pressurized air that allows them to
jump very high if they aim their cannons at the ground.
