Some believe that Cockatrices were born when reptiles or amphibians
incubated the eggs of other birds, but the truth is these are greatly adaptable
birds who very quickly evolved from a common ancestor.

Carrion Cackatrices live in arid environments inhabited by large creatures.
These Cockatrices have long stopped hunting, and now simply wait for one
beast to devour another, and eat what is left.
