The ice club that this creature carries has mystical properties. It is believed to
contain the core of a Coldslam Yeti, though the Rimefist can only channel its
powers to summon blizzards during battle. Some Magi have tried to replicate
its effects, but the only thing they have achieved after hours of meticulous study
and experiments is a puddle of cold water on their tables.
