The Elves inhabit the dark forests in the southern regions of the Rodian
Cutthroat Jungle, and they are not exactly kind to visitors. The Centaurs tried to
conquer their home thousands of years ago, and there has been little love
between the two races since then.

When an Elf Barbarian finds someone lurking around its territory, it will charge
towards them with a battle cry, then jump while raising its weapons to deliver a
powerful blow.
