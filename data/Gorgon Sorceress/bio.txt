The Gorgons come from a country where the use of magic is restricted and
beyond the reach of non-humans.

Gorgon Sorceresses are the most well versed in magic of their kind, and they
have learned fast on account of the books they borrow from the Familiars of the
Cornell Tower. Thanks to their knowledge, they have learned to prolong their
enemiesâ€™ fear by just staring at them.
