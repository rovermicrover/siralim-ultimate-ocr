Before joining the Red Hat order, Milner graduated as Mage from the Magic
University of Vanelin thanks to a famous study about Pit Wraiths. She
discovered that these creatures feed on unconsolidated temporal energy. That
is, the residual energy left behind by decisions that, when taken, prevented
actions with great consequences.

The claws of a Pit Wraith Redeemer age its enemies considerably for thirty
seconds. A festival attraction in Andolin promises to show the "future" for a
couple of coins. The sign reads: "Touch the hand of the beast and look in the
mirror!"
