It is common knowledge nowadays that resurrecting a dead person becomes
impossible after a certain amount of time has passed. Many throughout history
have tried to challenge death, however, even in recent times. One of the
byproducts of this stubborn obsession to overcome a universal law is the Trick
Imler, a lifeless creature animated only by magical impulses that run through
an artificial nervous system. They were considered abominations at first, but in
time the Imlings accepted them as cheap labor. As these creatures are
mindless, they are capable of casting spells even with their bodies destroyed.
