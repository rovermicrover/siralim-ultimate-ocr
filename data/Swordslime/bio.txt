Concoctions can assume any form, although mast of them have a preference.
However, they usually just look like shapeless masses that leave trails of
radioactive waste in their path.

The Swordslime is the only Concoction who chooses relatively humanoid
forms, if humans and other intelligent bipedal creatures will pardon the
expression. It often lies on the floor and pretends to be a fallen warrior with a
sword stuck in the chest, but when its victim turns around, the Swordslime
stands up, ready to strike them down in a single backstabbing blow. Quite a
cowardly creature.
