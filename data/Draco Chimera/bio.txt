Chimeras have little need for food, but they have been created in such a way
that the meat of the species that commonly try to harm T'mere's creations is

Draco Chimeras are generally in charge of military strategy. All three heads
think fast and can agree on a plan with astonishing speed and no need for
words. Additionally, since they can fly over the battlefield, they can use their six
eyes to observe many places at once, allowing them to adjust their battle plans
with a broader perspective.
