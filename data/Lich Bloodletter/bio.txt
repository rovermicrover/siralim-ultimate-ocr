The Lich Bloodletter can use the blood of its enemies to cast powerful spells. It
often kills the weakest enemies first, taking advantage of the fact that they are
usually sent to the front lines, then uses their blood to store powerful spells in
its scepter to decimate the strongest enemies. If it gets bored, it sometimes
hunts stray animals or people, cutting them until they bleed to death.
