From a young age, Shapeshifters practice on the animals and plants around
them to imitate their patterns. At the age of eight, these creatures are already
capable of transforming into beings twice or half their size.

Life Shapeshifters often take care of the sick and wounded, assist with
deliveries and guide the elderly in their last moments of life. They have a strong
sense of justice and protect the weak, even above their own lives.
