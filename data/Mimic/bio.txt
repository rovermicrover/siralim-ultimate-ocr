Scientists have tried to study the Mimic for thousands of years to learn its
secrets. This usually results in chewed tables and shelves, broken test tubes
and shredded books scattered throughout the room and, with any luck, a
mostly unharmed individual. What is more, no Mage has succeeded in
extracting this creature's core, although the legendary Helmholtz stated in his
memoirs that he would have been able to discover how to do it, had he had
enough time.
