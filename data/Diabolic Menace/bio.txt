This creature is the most silent member of the Diabolic Horde. While everyone
else is eating and laughing around the campfire, this creature is usually alone
with its eyes closed, meditating on matters known only to itself. Its knowledge
of magic is exceptional and appreciated by its people, but in battle it prefers to
wield two axes to wipe out its enemies with fearsome might.
