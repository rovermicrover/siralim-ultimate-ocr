Gangrel's city guard is mostly made up of mysterious creatures skilled in
dual-wielding swords. They communicate silently through gestures, but only
when absolutely necessary. If one of their own is in danger, any Lunatio within
a radius of three miles knows it automatically, and will come to its aid without a
moment's hesitation. During the Unification War, their presence was key to
detecting surprise enemy attacks before it was too late.
