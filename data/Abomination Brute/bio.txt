Abominations are a result of Tartarith's actions in the Torture Chamber. To
create them, he overfeeds an individual for weeks, and then implants a second
head on their shoulder.

The Abomination Brute is the only one of its kind that is prone to violence, as
well as the only one who is good at it. It lets its enemies get as close as
possible by holding back, then grabs them by the arms and rips them off with
its brutal strength.
