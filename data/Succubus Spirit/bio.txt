In the past, there was a group who worshipped Sins, different from the Sin cult.
They performed songs and dances, magical rites that turned into lustful
practices. One day, at the height of their ecstasy, the Succubus Spirit
appeared. They watched the result of their worship with admiration and made it
their new god. With time, the songs and dances stopped, and the ceremonies
lost their true essence. Little by little, they abandoned their lives and became
shadows of what they once were.
