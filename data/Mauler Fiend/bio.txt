A Fiend's diet includes any organic being, including trees if there is a shortage
of creatures. As long as they are adequately fed, they can become faithful
companions, but if not, their owner will become their meal.

Mauler Fiends are the easiest of their kind to tame, so many criminal gangs
use them as pets. There are illegal fights of these creatures in the suburbs of
some cities, in which bets can be placed.
