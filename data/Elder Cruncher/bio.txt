Crunchers are born from the walls and columns of the Temple of Lies. This
phenomenon has not been studied in depth, as access to this realm was
restricted until very recently.

Due to their aggressive behavior, not many Crunchers reach the end of their
life expectancy, but those who survive for over two hundred years become
Elder Crunchers. These are the smartest of their kind and know how to choose
their prey, so they sooner or later end up leading small groups of younger
Crunchers.
