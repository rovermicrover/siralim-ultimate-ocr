The Prismatic Cruncher is a rare example of a Cruncher that was born from a
wall in which a Carbuncle had laid an egg. Unlike the rest of its kind, it only
feeds on rocks and metal, and it cares about the Carbuncles' well-being. Many
Carbuncles take advantage of the fact that the other Crunchers rarely attack
this creature and hide their eggs in the cracks of its shell. For this reason, it is a
multicolored creature whose pigmentation is determined by the species of
Carbuncle that laid the egg.
