Elves are devoted protectors of nature that try to spread their ideas and
customs to the rest of Rodia, by any means necessary.

Clerics are usually the spokespersons of their message, though if they are not
treated with respect, as is usually the case, they let their maces do the talking
instead. In battle, they prefer being on the front lines and try to make the
enemies lower their guard so that another Elf can take advantage and attack
them by surprise.
