Bards are the residual energy left behind when the soul of a literary artist or a
musician leaves its body for the afterlife. As with Shades, this does not always
happen.

The Bard Minstrel's harp is more an ornament than an instrument, but when
this creature runs its fingers through the "strings", it transmits soft melodies and
beautiful words to the minds of the people around it. Anyone nearby will feel the
imperative need to declare their love to their romantic interest.
