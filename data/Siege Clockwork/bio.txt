Clockworks make sure that everything in Damarel works properly. Each one
has its role, and they only act based on contingencies that are rarely too
complex.

Alexandria built the Siege Clockwork for the purpose of transporting material
from one place to another through the intricate maze of rails that runs through
the cogs of Damarel. Nowadays, with the arrival of outsiders, these creatures
also transport other Clockworks so they can face any threat as quickly as
possible.
