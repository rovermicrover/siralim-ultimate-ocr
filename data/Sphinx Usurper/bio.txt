The Sphinxes awakened the Mummies and used them to conquer the Kaito
Empire. This creature, along with the Swarm Mummy, burst into the throne
room and tore off the head of Ateppicmon, proclaiming itself the new Pharaoh.
Humans were forced into slavery by the Sphinxes, living in misery until the
Watchers arrived. When these creatures attacked the Empire, the humans did
not help the Sphinxes, instead fleeing far from the wastelands and leaving their
home to be consumed and fall into oblivion.
