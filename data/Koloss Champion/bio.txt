Kolosses are unique lifeforms, given their nature. The weapon they carry is, in
fact, the creature's real body, forged by Perdition during his early years as a
God.

Do not expect a conflict to reach a peaceful resolution when a Koloss
Champion is involved. According to an adventurer who recently explored
Sanctum Umbra, its anger can be measured based on the number of hands it
uses to strike. Be especially careful if you see the puppet holding the
Champion's body with bath hands.
