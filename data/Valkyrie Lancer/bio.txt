Valkyries are warriors who seek glory in battle; a race as old as the world.
Although they rarely take sides, their sense of justice pushes them to fight
against certain evil causes. The march of the Valkyries is never silent, despite
the fact that they never communicate with each other. It is said that Valkyries
do not speak, they sing. However, Valkyrie Lancers are the only ones who do
so. Their voice sounds like a distant echo full of vigor and energy, and it fills
their allies with courage.
