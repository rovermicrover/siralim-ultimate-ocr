The forested mountains of Neralim were the scene of vicious battles during the
Watcher War, thousands of years before it became a kingdom. When it was all
over, some of those mountains seemed to decide it was time to get up and
leave.

Summers in Neralim can be harsh due to the extreme heat and infrequent
rains. When the vegetation starts to suffer, the Hanyac Tremor carries water
from the rivers to help the forests of the kingdom.
