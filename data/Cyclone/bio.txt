Fascinated by the most violent storms of nature, Torun decided that the only
way he could improve them was to give them an angry face like his, so that
they could curse while unleashing their fury. For some reason, Storms seem to
hate fire, but instead of trying to extinguish it by raining on it, they emit powerful
electric shocks against the heat source with the intention of destroying it.

The Cyclone is the only one of its species who can use the lightning it produces
to temporarily blind its enemies.
