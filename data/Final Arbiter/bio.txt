Arbiters are creatures who roam around, resolving minor disputes by order of
the Auditors. Sometimes they simply chat with one or more of the parties
involved.

Of all of them, the Final Arbiter is the one that intervenes the most in the affairs
of those with fewer resources, and the only one who does more than speak or
go into battle. Recently, a group of Final Arbiters was seen helping in the
reconstruction of a town in Neralim that had suffered an earthquake.
