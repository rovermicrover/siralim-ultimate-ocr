These creatures are the reason why many villages and towns have Familiars
watching over the streets, signs with drawings of Familiars, or even scarecrows
in the shape of them, as Mutated Pulse Bats are quite scared of that species.
They are self-aware, and they find it easier to raid human larders than to waste
time hunting for wild animals.
