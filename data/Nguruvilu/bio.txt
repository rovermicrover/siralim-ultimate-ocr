Lake Kalazan makes up a large part of the kingdom of Andolin. There begins
the life cycle of the creatures called Nguruvilu. When they reach maturity, most
of them descend the Sevinor River and travel to other regions. They hide under
the water, motionless, waiting for prey to pass over them â€” unless they detect
magic. The presence of a Mage or a magical beast pushes them to the
surface, as their scent is irresistible to them.
