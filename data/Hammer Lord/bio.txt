The Smithsâ€™ arrival in what is now Radia supposed a revolution in the field of
blacksmithing, as their methods and materials were groundbreaking for the
time. During the Unification War, King Misery enslaved all of Caedo's Smiths to
produce weapons, armor and artifacts without rest. Many of them died of
exhaustion, but that did not stop the Last King of Caedo, who began to kidnap
Smiths from other kingdoms, and even offered a bounty to anyone who brought
him one.
