Humans hunted Carbuncles to near-total extinction as they waged war against
their neighboring towns and cities. The Watcher War began soon after.

Emerald Carbuncles are braver and more cunning than the rest of their
species. Taking advantage of their cute and delicate appearance, they
approach children who are playing away from their parents and attract them by
levitating happily around them. When it gets their attention, it leads them into
the middle of the forest until a predator finds them and kills them.
