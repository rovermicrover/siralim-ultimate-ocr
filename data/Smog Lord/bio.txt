Some agricultural companies hire mercenaries to capture Smogs and drop
them in the fields of the competition. These practices are punished by law,
which is why other companies pretend to have suffered an attack in order to
falsely accuse their rivals.

Smog Lords are an exception among their kind, as they do not target the
common people of Radia. They used to be workers who were not prisoners of
war, so they direct their attacks toward the universities of magic and the
leaders of each kingdom.
