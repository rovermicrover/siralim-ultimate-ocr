Rift Dancers are part of the iconography of mausoleums and cemeteries in
many cities. The Inaer variety are more commonly seen during clear days.
Those lucky enough can find a large number of them in places far from
civilization, gathered in a dance in which they interlock their bodies, changing
partners with every turn. This dance is known as the Dance of Fire, and some
humans have tried to imitate it without much success.
