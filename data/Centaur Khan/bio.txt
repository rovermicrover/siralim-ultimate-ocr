The Centaur Khan carries the banner of its people. When a battle begins, it
sets it up like a spear and charges its enemies, striking powerful blows with the
stone-carved skull at the end of it. Sometimes, the wood that supports it ends
up breaking, but that does not prevent it from fighting with what is left of the
banner, or its fists, kicks, and shield.
