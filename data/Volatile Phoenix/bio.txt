Phoenixes are birds that only lay one egg during each of their life cycles. The
eggs take six months to open and must be incubated under very strict
conditions for the chick to develop successfully.

The Volatile Phoenix is the fastest and most skilled of its kind. It can plummet
and swerve sharply at the last moment, casting a powerful spell on its enemies.
