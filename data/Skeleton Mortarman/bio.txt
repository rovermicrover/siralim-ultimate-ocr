The Skeletons used to be pirates in unknown waters some time ago, but now
they have no choice but to wander Rodia, committing all kinds of misdeeds.
The spread of this creature's weapon allows it to hit several enemies at once if
they are close to each other. The Skeletons that travel with it often keep an eye
on their belongings, as it has been known to steal coins and use them as
bullets once it runs out of ammunition.
