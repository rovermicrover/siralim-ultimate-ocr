The Automaton blueprints were illegaly sold by an unscrupulous scientist to
several wealthy people in Radia, including two of the top mafia bosses.

For an Automaton to recognize an individual as its master, the palm of their
hand must be placed on the machine's back for one minute. If it already
belonged to someone, their ownership will be overriden.

The Decrepit Automaton is a faulty but functional model, so no one usually
bathers to fix it. Plants grow quickly in its gears, tubes and body, and make
their way outward in a way that allows the machine to use them as weapons.
