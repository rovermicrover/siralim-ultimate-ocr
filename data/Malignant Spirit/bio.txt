When Tartarith became a God after his son's torture, he returned the pain he
had caused him three times over. When Taylor exhaled his last breath, the

creatures. Its very presence is terrifying, and it only gets worse once it
approaches. It can enter people's thoughts and bring out their fears and
worries, not letting them disappear from their minds.
