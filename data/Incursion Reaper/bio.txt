Despite their unsettling appearance and the sharp scythe they carry with them,
Reapers are not aggressive unless they are attacked. They have eternal life
and are immune to all diseases. However, they are not immune to the effects
of magic.

If a creature's time has not yet come, the Incursion Reaper may decide to use
its scythe to return it fo a previous state where it was healthy.
