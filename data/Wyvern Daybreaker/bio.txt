When Wyverns find an adversary worthy of their strength, they perch on their
legs and gather their wings as a sign of respect. Depending on what their
opponent does next, they may even join them.

Wyvern Daybreakers nest in the Frostbite Caverns, hiding their eggs in hollow
spaces on the frozen walls. Once the clutch is laid, these creatures leave the
cold regions until after their next reproductive cycle. The young must survive in
a hostile environment that punishes weakness with death.
