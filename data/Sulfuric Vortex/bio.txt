Every Vortex is powered by pure magic and needs to consume at least one
Spell Gem every three days to keep its structure intact.

Sulfuric Vortices are made up of a corrosive magical substance that produces
first-degree burns in just a moment of contact with the skin. This property gets
stronger the smaller they are, and they can easily pierce their enemies" bodies
at high speed when they are at their smallest size.
