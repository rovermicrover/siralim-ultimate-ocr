When it rains, Tremors remain motionless, completely relaxed. Unless a
defenseless animal is in danger, they will never move under these
circumstances. The forces of King Misery could not invade Neralim because
the city's commander deployed a large number of these creatures near the
walls to make the ground tremble, thus hindering the advance of the invading
troops.

A Quarnok Tremor can throw the racks of its body at high speed, and they
often hit its enemiesâ€™ heads when they stop moving.
