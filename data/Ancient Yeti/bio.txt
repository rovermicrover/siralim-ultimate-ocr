There is a legend in Sithicus about a gigantic Yeti that appeases the most
violent snowstorms, though some believe it is just a Winter Aspect, and that the
furious gales of snow are actually a product of the Ancient Yeti's will. While it is
true that it can channel the cold of the frozen mountains, its only concern
nowadays is to eliminate the ruler of Siralim to prevent its home from being
destroyed. As a precaution, it has decided to kill any Mage who crosses its path.
