Heretic Hunters are an exception within their culture in regard to the faith they
choose to profess. They usually worship a Chaos God, though in no case are
they repudiated by their own, to the surprise of the scholars of non-human
societies. They are silent, bloodthirsty warriors who take advantage of the
powers bestowed by the deities they worship, as well as their bond with the
group to enhance their blows.
