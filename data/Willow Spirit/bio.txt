The Willow Spirits appeared in the meadows and forests after the humans
brought their magic to them. They appeared before Nature Magi were
recognized as a specialized branch. They are the protectors of the forest, who
watch over the lives of all the beings that inhabit it. However, they cannot tell
apart the threats to the forest from its protectors, so they simply heal the
warrior with more wounds.
