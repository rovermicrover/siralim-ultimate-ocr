During the Apollinaire incident in the Columbia Tower, a famous Mage started
an experiment to save his own life. He succeeded in transferring his soul to a
book, though it took some time for him to accept his new life. For several
centuries he continued his studies in the tower, until the unexpected arrival of
the Familiars. Accustomed to his new life, the Hidden Grimoire welcomed
Washburn and her kind. He still lives with the Familiars in this tower, which they
renamed Cornell in his honor.
