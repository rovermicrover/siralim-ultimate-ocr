It all started with an ambitious Avion rider who did not respect the rules, and an
unscrupulous Mage who only cared about gold. The result was a creature that

never quite hatched from the egg. In fact, the eggshell itself is part of its body,

which functions as a carapace of sorts. This creature tries to imitate Avion, but
is rejected by them and only interacts with others of its kind.
