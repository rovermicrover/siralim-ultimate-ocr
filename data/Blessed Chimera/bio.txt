Chimeras are very different from each other, yet they all share a common
goalâ€”to protect T'mere M'rgo's creations from the criminals who seek to
capture them.

The Blessed Chimera is so intense that its siblings often find it irritating. It
keeps talking about the importance of their mission until other Chimeras get
away from it, so Blessed Chimeras mostly interact among themselves. They
detest all intelligent creatures outside the Amalgam Gardens, as they believe
they would all plunder T'mere's realm if they were not so scared.
