When Erebyss created the Carnages, she put special emphasis on making
them the perfect killing machines. They are agile and cunning, stealthy when
they want to be, and can end a person's life in just a moment.

Carnage Tormenters can smell fear, and they even take pleasure in the cries
and screams of their enemies. The truth is that they feed on negative emotions,
so they will prolong their prey's suffering as much as possible until they are
sated.
