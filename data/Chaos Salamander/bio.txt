A famous archaeologist recently found the mittens of a violent warrior from a
thousand years ago in the depths of the Cutthroat Jungle. To do so, she
ordered her Water Salamander to activate the powers of the artifact. The soul
of the warrior, trapped in the mittens, manifested and took over the creature's
body. The Salamander soon turned on its owner and ended her life. It then left
the ruined temple, looking for more adversaries to defeat.
