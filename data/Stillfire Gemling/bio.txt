It is believed that Carbuncles pass on their memories from one generation to
the next through the gems on their foreheads. If this is the case, Gemlings also
have those memories, as they were created by using the gems of several
Carbuncles, the descendants of those who failed to escape thousands of years
ago.

Stillfire Gemlings are the most dangerous of their kind, since their bodies can
produce enough heat to burn wood in a matter of minutes. Because of this,
more than a dozen floors of the Refuge of the Magi were permanently closed
after being consumed by the flames.
