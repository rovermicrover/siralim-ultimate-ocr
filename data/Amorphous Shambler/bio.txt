William James and his crew visited hidden and forgotten places on the high
seas. Deep in the Boreal Ocean, where he and his people were cursed, he
discovered creatures who could not die. The waters were riddled with
amorphous beings capable of levitating in their unlife. At first, some of the
captain's crew thought they might be edible, but their rotten stench was
warning enough not to. Sea Shamblers are not aggressive creatures by nature,
but when the captain's ships sailed over shoals of these creatures, many were
hit hard, causing a fight in which no member of the crew lost their life.
