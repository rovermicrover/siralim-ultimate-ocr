Due to unknown circumstances, some groups of Hunters become evil and
travel Rodia while committing misdeeds. At the head of such groups there is
always a Silent Hunter, an individual that carries no religious item, which leads
scholars of non-human sacieties to believe they do not profess any faith. They
are extremely cruel and bloodthirsty, and often plunder small villages and
towns at night, stealing everything they can carry and murdering the inhabitants
in cold blood.
