Kapre was a male Nix who managed to survive the genocide that took place
over nine hundred years ago on another continent. Although the Elves were
never kind to visitors, some sheltered refugees in their forests until the war
came to an end. Kapre was never a great warrior, but he was a good friend of
Elinar even after he became Morning Star. When he learned that Elinar was
going to leave this world forever, he accompanied him without thinking twice.
Apacranox, already a God, gave his friend the gift of eternal life, and from that
moment they lived together in the Blood Grove. Kapre has learned to fight over
the years, as he wanted to help the Satyrs and Inquisitors in their eternal war
against the Efts.
