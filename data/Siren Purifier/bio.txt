Siren Purifiers can smell evil miles away, but their senses have atrophied
because of the sheer number of stimuli they receive constantly. They are
unable to differentiate between true villainy and simple selfish actions without
importance. These creatures can summon blue fire in the palm of their hands
that makes any creature hit by it fall asleep. This is especially dangerous for
ships at night, as the Siren Purifier often targets the helmsperson and causes
the entire crew to lose their way.
