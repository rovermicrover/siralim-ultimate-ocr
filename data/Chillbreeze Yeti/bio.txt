Yetis were created by Azural thousands of years ago, but their numbers have
been drastically reduced over the ages, especially due to hunting.

Chillbreeze Yetis dislike eating warm, freshly-caught prey. Before they put it in
their mouths, they first place it near a snowstorm to let it cool, and usually they
do not eat it until it looks like a block of ice and frost.
