Krakens were a danger to humans who sailed the high seas. But above all,
they have been a serious threat to the Revenants for centuries, as both species
inhabit the ocean depths.

No other Kraken sowed as much fear and destruction as the Hundredhand,
who can catch dozens of Revenants at once with its tentacles. Today,
Revenants catch these creatures and keep them in cages, feeding them and
cutting their tentacles daily as they continually regenerate, making them a
virtually limitless food source.
