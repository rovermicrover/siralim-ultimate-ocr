The Constructs helped the army of Nex to protect civilians in the streets of the
capital and to guard its walls. When the war was about to end, they became
available for general purchase in the kingdom.

The Nightveil Construct is equipped with a speech synthesizer that activates in
certain conditions. Moreover, it can store voice messages in its memory, which
makes it a particularly useful nighttime messenger, due also to its ability to go
unnoticed in the dark.
