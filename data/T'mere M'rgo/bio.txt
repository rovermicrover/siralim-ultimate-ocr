This God spends most of his time giving life to creatures in his realm. However,
none of them are really original, as their bodies are made up of parts from
different beingsâ€”the reason why he calls himself the Gad of Fusion. Although
many of these creatures have terrifying forms, none are especially dangerous
for a well-prepared adventurer. It was not until the Amalgam Gardens were
invaded by malicious outsiders that T'mere decided to give life to truly
dangerous creatures with the sole purpose of protecting his creations.
