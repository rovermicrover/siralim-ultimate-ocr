Sea Shamblers are somehow able to reproduce, but they lose their instincts
and intelligence with each generation, with the exception of the Juggernaut,
who is not undead, and the Lugubrious, due to its special nature.

William James dropped anchors on the western coast of Radia, near the
kingdom of Ahruna. Much of his fleet had sunk into the Boreal Ocean, and
what remained was severely damaged. Still, there was room enough on their
ships for the large numbers of exotic creatures they took with them.

The Innocent Shambler, as the pirate crew named it, was one of the undead
creatures they found in the Boreal Ocean. They are meek, but skilled hunters,
and although they do not need to feed, they have not lost their instincts.
Occasionally, they capture prey and try to devour it, but pieces of chewed meat
inevitably trickle out of the holes in their body.
