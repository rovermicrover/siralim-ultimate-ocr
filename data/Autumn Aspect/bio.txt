Sometimes, when the dry leaves are carried by the wind, they form a
copper-colored whirlwind that rustles violently. When it stops, a noble,
surly-looking creature can be seen. Like the other Aspects, they are considered
holy creatures by Nature Magi, though every Mage respects them to some
extent, as they are known to keep the balance between the seasons. If a region
does not wither as it should during the fall, this creature will accelerate the
process.
