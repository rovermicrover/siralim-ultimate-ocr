Hexilo was a necromancer blinded by his search of knowledge. For more than
a decade he faced River, Siralim's most powerful Magi at the time. In reality,
they both studied together at the Refuge of the Magi, and were very good
friends, but Hexilo left the kingdom after graduating and unleashed chaos in a
nearby nation with his experiments. In the midst of one of their countless
battles, Dragan himself, one of the two founders of the Auditors, appeared in
person and stopped the fight, not without some difficulty. Hexilo accepted the
offer without hesitation, fascinated by the idea of the organization; while River,
who had serious doubts, only did it to keep tabs on his arch-enemy. For over
ten years, Hexilo worked for the Auditors under the codename Twilight. After
the incident in the Refuge of the Magi, the number of Voidlords increased
exponentially. Sevalah knew that even the power of Tenebris would be
insufficient to create a place capable of attracting the Voidlords to reduce their
influx, so she designed a plan in which Mortem would also participate. Thus,
the two ancient rivals created the Bastion of the Void.
