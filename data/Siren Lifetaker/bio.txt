The Siren Lifetaker was once a Coercer who, after decades of living in this
world, decided to get serious. It only acts at night and it moves stealthily,
avoiding being seen by crowds. It is observant and cautious, and only begins to
sing when it knows it has the advantage over its victims. Its song, perfected for
years, is much more effective than that of the other Sirens. When its audience
approaches, it glides gracefully and lets the edge of its scythe slice each neck.
