When the Forsaken and the Ghouls began to hunt the civilians of Omnia, there
was a massive flight to the upper levels of the city. To protect the upper
echelons, the city guard had a Minotaur Earthshaker destroy the last steps of
the famous glass stairs. Hundreds of people lost their lives, and the women
who were crushed became Swampdwellers. When they fight in a magic
environment, they plant their tentacles on the ground to absorb the energy and
strengthen themselves.
