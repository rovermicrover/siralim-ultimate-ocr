The Dragon Soldier received its name centuries ago, when King Misery placed
the city of Neralim under siege with his army of knights and creatures. The
Unification forces could not abandon their positions to help the city, but Milner
had an idea. She went to the Unsullied Meadows and spoke with the Dragon
Queens, but they did not listen. Distressed, she put her hope in a legend. Her
wish made these creatures emerge from the sea and give their lives for the
country without asking for payment.
