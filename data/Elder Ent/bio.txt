At the end of its long life, the structure of an Ent changes and a sticky moss
begins to cover its body. It is common to find hummingbirds and other small
birds around it, and a scientist from Vanelin discovered that they ignore the
insects that get trapped in the mass, instead eating the moss itself. The
scientist caught one of these creatures to study it and found out that its skin
contained a hallucinogenic substance that is addictive to birds.
