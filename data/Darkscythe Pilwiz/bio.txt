Although they only live in villages and small towns, Pilwiz society is strongly
linked to that of humans, so much that both species have become dependent
on each other.

The Darkscythe Pilwiz is the guardian of the night. Many creatures wait under
the cover of darkness to stalk their prey or commit illegal activities related to
the theft of vegetables or cereals. This creature never warns and never asks
questions. It stealthily approaches any intruders and appears behind them,
ready to attack.
