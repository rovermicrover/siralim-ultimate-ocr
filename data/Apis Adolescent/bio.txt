The Apis Adolescent owes its name to its lack of horns. However, it is similar in
size to the other Apis, which begin to grow horns immediately after birth. In the
past, it was able to channel the power of other Apis to increase their power over
the weather and the soil's fertility, helping them change whatever they wished.
At present, these creatures can turn certain spells into an energy blast that
deals massive damage to whoever cast them.
