Before he became a God, Mikhail was a legendary hitman who was recruited
by the Auditors. Under the codename Eve he carried out numerous missions
for the organization, both on his own and with his group of six agents. He grew
up on the streets with a group of bandits who one by one lost their lives until
only he was left alive. He had always been a detached, cold, and calculating
person, but things began to change when he met his five companions. They
formed a powerful bond of friendship, and when he became Venedon ten years
later, he said goodbye to his friends in tears. Venedon still uses the weapons
he had while he was a mortal, two state-of-the-art fully automatic firearms
designed on the continent beyond the Veil. They also have a telescopic sight to
shoot long distances.
