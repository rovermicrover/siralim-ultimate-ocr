Even though the body of an Ossein is made entirely of bone, they possess
extraordinary toughness due to the nature of the creature from whom they
emerged. This is more noticeable in the case of the Ossein Defenders, since
they often choose to block their enemiesâ€™ blows. No matter how many spells,
arrows and blades strike its shield, it is never damaged at the end of a fight.
