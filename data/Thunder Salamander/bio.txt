Most of these creatures inhabit a region of Crux that is usually hit by strong
storms, and do not allow anyone to approach their territory. A large group can
alter the path of lightning bolts at will and decide where they will hit with
incredible accuracy. In addition, the electricity that runs through their body
interacts with the magic around them, sometimes allowing them to replicate it
effortlessly. The authorities of Rodia strongly recommend keeping a safe
distance from these creatures.
