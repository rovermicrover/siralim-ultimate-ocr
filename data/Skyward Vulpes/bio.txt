Originally from the snowy regions of Rodia, Skyward Vulpes quickly became
famous for the cold emanating from their bodies. Indeed, some experienced
Magi have begun to hunt and sell them to the wealthiest people in the country
as an ostentatious method of food preservation, and to cool their homes during
the warm season. They are usually locked up in cages, which are then placed
in the pantries of these morally bankrupt individuals.
