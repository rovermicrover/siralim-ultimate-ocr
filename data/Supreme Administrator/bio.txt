This creature is not really a Demigod, although it is programmed to speak like
them. To protect Ubi Concordia, a utopic city the Auditors built near the North
Pole, thousands of robots were built with the sole purpose of exterminating
anyone who managed to overcome the magical barrier Dragan and other Magi
had erected around the city. To date, these robots have never had to execute
their only order, but copies of them have slipped through the Itherian Realms,
making it possible to see these creatures elsewhere.
