The bite of the Sabertooth Manticore is as good as that of the Martyaxwar, but
its fangs are so durable that they can also block sharp weapons as if they were
a shield. Sooner or later, the fangs suffer visible damage or even break off.
Luckily for this creature, it can shed them once a month, and they only take
four days to regrow, as strong as they were before.
