There are no written records of Rift Dancers until the time of the first wars in
which magic played an important role.

Nadin Rift Dancers detest the darkness, so they gather near the lights of city
walls or village squares during the night. As they do not pose a threat to most
people, even children are allowed to play with them, and they are considered to
be a fascinating sight. Some people even allow them into their homes and let
them spend the night by candlelight.
