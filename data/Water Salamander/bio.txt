Water Salamanders rarely leave the rivers and lakes they inhabit. Their
structure remains relatively intact compared to that of the other Salamanders,
although they have extraordinary magic abilities that allow them to effortlessly
activate the effect of any enchanted item. A famous archaeologist recently
used one of these creatures to help her discover the location of an ancient
artifact inside an abandoned temple in the Cutthroat Jungle.
