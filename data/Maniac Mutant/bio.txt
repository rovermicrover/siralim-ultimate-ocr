Maniacs do not sleep, and although they prefer to attack their own kind, food
shortages or boredom have at times made them a threat to society.

The Maniac Mutant is the only one of its species who has a tail and only one
eye. They usually have a calmer demeanor, but they are treated with contempt
by other Maniacs and incited to violence, so most end up developing the typical
restless, aggressive attitude of their kind.
