With the passage of ages, the cycle of life inexorably led to the natural deaths
of thousands and thousands of Carbuncles. When a Carbuncle dies, its body
becomes dust, but the gem on its forehead remains intact, retaining its power
for centuries. Most of these gems ended up becoming food for the Crunchers,
but many remained hidden. As if it were their fate, one by one they met and
merged until, two thousand years later, they became a self-aware being.
Aurum is faithfully devoted to order, and he loves feeling like the supreme
being of his own world. He is the manifestation of pure magic, and is not
affected by legends, hopes or faith. After the ruler of Siralim first met this God,
one of their advisors raised the possibility that Vertraag had planned the
existence of this deity from the beginning, since his mere presence seems to
have a crucial role in the stability of the world.
