Although Grimoires can live forever, their structure is vulnerable to events
where a great amount of magic is unleashed. This has caused alterations in the
spells they contain after events such as the Unification War or the ascension to
godhaood of an old ruler of Siralim.

The Forbidden Grimoire once contained spells that could instantly kill whoever
cast them. That is why only the most skilled Magi can safely look at its pages
and read the letters, numbers and runes they contain.
