The Crypt was once a sacred place where the bodies of the deceased were laid
to rest so that they would have a peaceful journey to the afterlife. The first to
summon this creature was Baker, a renowned Life Mage who had recently lost
her great love. One night, she went into the cemetery and looked for her lover's
crypt to bring her back to life with an experimental spell. But something went
wrong, and instead of bringing her back, the spell gave life to the building in
which she was buried.
