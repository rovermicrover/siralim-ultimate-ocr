The body of this creature is at a temperature close to absolute zero even on the
hottest days of summer. A cunning commander of Andolin had one freeze the
surface of a lake on the eve of an important battle. After placing his army in
what seemed like an unfavorable position, the enemy fell into the trap and
divided their troops, half of whom crossed the lake. Then he had his Minotaur
Earthshaker shatter the ice with its powerful mace. They wore heavy armor, so
there were hardly any survivors.
