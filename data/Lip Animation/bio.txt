The lifespan of an Animation is very short, barely reaching three months,
unless its creator or current master gives it a Spell Gem for it to absorb.

The Lip Animation cannot avoid eating or drinking whatever is in front of it,
unless their master gives an order to the contrary every few minutes. Most of
the time, food and liquid just pass through it, but boiling water or fish bones can
cause serious damage to these creatures.
