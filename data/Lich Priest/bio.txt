It is said that the Lich Order is as old as Death Magic, although this is nothing
more than hearsay. Its hordes of Priests can block the roads and attack cities
alongside their superiors if nothing stops them. The touch of their hands can
heat up armor until it burns the wearer, and they regenerate from any blow that
does not destroy their skull, as if their bones were magnetized.
