Hounds typically live in packs and develop elaborate strategies that never fail to
catch prey.

A drop of blood is enough for the Blood Hound to track its prey, no matter the
distance or the species it is following. When it finds its quarry, it does not
pounce on it without thinking, instead waiting for its pack to arrive and
assessing the situation before developing a strategy.
