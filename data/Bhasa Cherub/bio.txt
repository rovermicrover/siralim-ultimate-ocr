The Cherubs are celestial beings that have long been a source of great
consternation to scholars of the arcane and divine. Numerous studies have
been attempted upon these creatures, but other than that they contain
tremendous amounts of magical energy, solid conclusions have been hard to
come by despite centuries of attempted studies.

The Bhasa Cherub always glows with a soft light at all times, but when it
considers itself imperiled it is capable of emitting an extreme amount of bright
light. The gleam is so bright it has been known to erode and bleach materials in
the area, burning the shadows of those surrounding it into the walls and ground.
