Finding a Griffon nest is extremely hard, as they usually choose high,
inaccessible places to lay eggs and feed their chicks. Therefore, their eggs are
considered a delicacy in Rodia, and the people in the upper echelons of society
often pay a fortune to obtain them. If, in spite of the difficulties, someone
manages to steal several eggs, a Griffon Dreamfinder may track that person
down, as they are capable of detecting the presence of their relatives at great
distances.
