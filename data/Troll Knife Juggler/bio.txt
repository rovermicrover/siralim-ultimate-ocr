Trolls are sometimes the center of attention in the cities, which is somehow
justified because of their history. Of course, there are some exceptions and
some Trolls make an honest living, like the Knife Jugglers that perform
fantastic shows on the streets. They still need to let off some steam, however,
so they get a little extra money by robbing travelers outside the walls.
