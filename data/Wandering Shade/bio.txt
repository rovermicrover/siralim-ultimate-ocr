There was once a human empress who decreed a genocide against all
civilized, non-human creatures in her kingdom on another continent. Many of
her people collaborated for fear of reprisals, either from their neighbors or from
the armed forces. The humans' numerical superiority forced many of such
creatures into exile, until finally none remained in the kingdom, ather than
Elves. At present, the Shade she produced is the most powerful of all, and still
roams the world insatiably searching for non-human creatures to annihilate.
