When the city of Andolin was quarantined because of a terrible disease, Plague
Doctors began to appear mysteriously. In less than a week, they healed the
sick and disappeared as quickly as they arrived.

Some wounds or illnesses are too serious for even a Plague Doctor to heal.
The Plague Scholar knows when to give up, but before doing so it prepares a
potion that emotionally relaxes the sick person and their closest people so that
they can calmly accept what is to come.
