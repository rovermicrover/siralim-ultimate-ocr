At present, dryads carry a sprout from the tree that gave them life. In this way,
they can travel to distant lands, and even plant the sprout to replace their oak if
it were to perish.

When a Dryad Warden finds someone lighting a fire where they should not,
she uses her power to absorb the heat of the flames and holds it over her hand.
With a homicidal look in her eyes, she throws the fire at the offender to burn
them alive.
