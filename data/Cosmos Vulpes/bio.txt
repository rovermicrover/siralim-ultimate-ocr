Unlike other Vulpes, this creature has not lost its animal instincts and can still
be seen stalking rabbits and small birds, although it does not need to feed on
them anymore. Since most of Rodia's Vulpes have stopped hunting their old

prey, many farmers in the region have asked the authorities to repopulate the
area with this particular variety.
