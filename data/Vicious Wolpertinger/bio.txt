The origin of Wolpertingers can be traced back to a spectacular accident which
involved eight Nature Magi, several endangered birds and a series of complex
spells.

The Vicious Wolpertinger attacks anyone who carries a magic item. Indeed,
mountain wildlife experts know that these creatures eagerly devour artifacts,
and that it is preferable to throw away a sword or a shield as a last resort,
rather than lose one's life.
