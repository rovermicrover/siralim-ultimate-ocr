Magic is a mystery to the Wolpertingers, and yet they are not a mystery to
magic. These creatures rarely cast spells of their own volition. Instead, magic
spontaneously manifests around them when they are in danger.

Although the Vile Wolpertinger can hunt a great number of animals without
much trouble to obtain food, it prefers to look for the places where other
creatures hide their young and devour them without mercy.
