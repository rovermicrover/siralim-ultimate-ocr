Banshees are mysterious creatures that are as old as the world. Their
silhouette can sometimes be seen in the dark of night, completely motionless,
as if waiting for something.

The Abyss Banshee is feared by all Magi, as its screams consume the magical
energy that is necessary to cast spells. Moreover, prolonged exposure to the
screams can break magic items, rendering them unusable.
