Sirens were once peaceful beings who over the years witnessed the atrocities
of humans and other intelligent creatures. Today, many of them feel the need
to punish mortals.

The Siren Coercer has learned much from other intelligent beings and knows
how to wield their weapons and tools. At night, it sneaks into the cabins of the
ships and murders the sleeping sailors one by one, plunging its knife into their
chest.
