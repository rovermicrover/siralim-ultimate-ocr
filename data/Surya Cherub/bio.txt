While most Cherubs have resided within the Azure Dream since ancient times,
they have been known to occasionally vanish without explanation, never to
return. In recent times however these disappearances have accelerated to the
point that the sight of a Cherub within the Azure Dream is now an incredibly
rare sight. Within the Church of Surathli and the Cult of Yseros, this is widely
considered a very bad omen.

Wreathed in flames, the Surya Cherub radiates such intense heat that it is
tremendously dangerous to approach. Many Magi have inadvertently met an
unfortunate scorched end by the mere act of trying to summon and control one
of these creatures, without the Cherub making a single hostile action at all or
seemingly even being aware of what its presence is causing.
