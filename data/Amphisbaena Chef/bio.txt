Amphisbaenas are creatures who can perform specific tasks flawlessly. They
are normally gentle, kind, and charming, and try to solve problems through
dialogue, keeping in mind other people's arguments and points of view.

Some Amphisbaenas were literally born to cook. They just need to test the
ingredients separately to know if combining them is a good idea. Today, this
knowledge is available to everyone, thanks to the numerous cookbooks that
have been published based on their discoveries.
