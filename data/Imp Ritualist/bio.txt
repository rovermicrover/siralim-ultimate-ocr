The Imps of the Cutthroat Jungle worship pagan gods that they themselves
invented. Torun hates these practices, but his strings of expletives cannot
prevent them from gathering at night to dance around their idols.

With a spasmodic dance, the Imp Ritualist moves among its companions,
waving its spear while making a tremendous effort not to spill the flammable
liquid that it carries in its other hand. This grotesque display surprisingly seems
to establish a mystical connection among its allies.
