This creature owes its name to its sinister appearance that has scared many
travelers. However, people who live near caves or very dense forests where
sunlight barely shines through the canopy know there is no reason to be afraid
of them. In such places, it is common to have heard stories in which someone
who was missing returns several days later thanks to an Evil Spirit's help.
