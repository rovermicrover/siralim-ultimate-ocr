This creature looks like an Apocalypse, but it is not one of them. It was
artificially created by the Auditors and ordered to stop any outsiders who enter
Ubi Concordia. The cry of the so-called Zzyia Apocalypse chills anyone who
hears it to the bone, as it was programmed to do. During the development of
this creature, the Auditors researched which sounds activated the parts of the
brain that produce fear, until they found one capable of terrorizing hundreds of
different species.
