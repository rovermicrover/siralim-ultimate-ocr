This creature was made by a group of students from the Magic University of
Neralim during a drunken night, with the purpose of creating the ultimate billiard
player. Naturally, several things went wrong and they ended up giving life to a
creature obsessed with bar games, but with no special ability to excel in them,
who was also a sore loser and kept causing problems. Finally, the students
were made to clean the campus grounds for two weeks as punishment, and
the creature was released after the dean herself cast a powerful spell on it that
fixed its bad personality.
