The substance that the Auditors inject into some creatures is harmless in life.
However, after death, these creatures" souls will arrive at Ubi Concordia, where
they will enter a body the Auditors prepared for them, and act as Arbiters from
that moment on.

Thinking Arbiters carry out the most subtle tasks. They tend to stroll through big
cities, and are often seen both in the good and bad neighborhoods. Their
interventions are never too long, but their words can exert an influence capable
of unleashing all kinds of events, from a student strike to, perhaps in the future,
a coup d'Ã©tat.
