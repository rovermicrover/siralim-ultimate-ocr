Carnages can perfectly adapt to any situation, making use of their seven limbs
or their terrible jaws depending on their enemy's skill. One of them could
massacre a small town without much difficulty. It is for this reason that Erebyss
forbade them from getting close to civilization unless it is under the command
of a person wha can control them... or until she rescinds the order.

The Shadow Carnage can open portals to and from the Path of the Damned
and catch its enemies by surprise.
