Familiars love reading and studying magic, which is why it is rare to find one
that does not carry a book. They are expert Bat hunters, using their knowledge
about the emission and reception of ultrasounds to lead them to a trap.

If another creature chooses the Arcane Familiar as prey, it will defend itself by
hitting its enemy on the legs with its cane without causing unnecessary
damage.
