At night, Hunters light bonfires and dance around the flames for hours while
their wolf companions play on the dirt, biting and pouncing on each other. The
Moon Hunter, however, stands aside and meditates. The crescent-shaped
edge of its staff shines brightly during the dance, as it is recharged with the
positive energy that results from the Hunters strengthening their bonds. This
makes the weapon much deadlier in battle.
