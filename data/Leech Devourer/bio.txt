These creatures are believed to have been created by the Gods in ancient
times, when they began to shape the world. They were probably considered a
failed experiment, and were therefore banished beyond the realms of the
Gods. The Leech Devourer is a clear example of this. It is technically able to
swallow any animal whole, although in a very awkward way. If it manages to do
it, however, its digestive system collapses and ends up killing the Leech.
