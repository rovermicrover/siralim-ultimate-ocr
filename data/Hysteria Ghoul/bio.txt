When the civilians and soldiers of Omnia lost their lives during the siege, their
bodies underwent a brutal transformation. Men and women were affected
differently. In the case of men, they became creatures that the victors later
called Ghouls.

When a Hysteria Ghoul finds a target to devour, the irrepressible urge to do so
can be transmitted to the warriors around him. Sometimes, even herbivore
creatures end up biting off flesh.
