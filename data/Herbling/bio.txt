This creature's roots are not entirely visible unless magic is used. They stretch
out a great distance beyond what the eye can see, and cling to the creature's
allies. In this way, it receives nourishment when they act, gaining power for a
limited time. However, this creature is extremely hard to breed and needs
proper care to even survive longer than a few days, so many biologists already
consider this species extinct.
