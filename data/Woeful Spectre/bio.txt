When Sigmund cast his curse, this creature appeared in the country. It is
believed that its existence is linked to the curse, that destroying it is one of the
conditions to end it. It can tear through time with its knife and create temporal
rifts with which to move to other eras. The dark lord is said to have disappeared
through a rift when he was about to be defeated by Helmholtz and Milner.
Ancther theory is that Sigmund became this creature, and all these events
were orchestrated by Vertraag.
