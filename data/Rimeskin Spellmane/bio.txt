Spellmanes are extremely territorial, and they do not tolerate under any
circumstances the presence of another member of their species, unless it is
their offspring.

The Frostbite Caverns are home to the Rimeskin. To hunt travelers and other
creatures, they very often scale the icy walls with their sharp claws to climb to
the ceiling, posing as stalactites. When their prey passes under them, they only
have to drop down to end its life in a quick and grisly way.
