Rodia has definitely earned its reputation for being a country riddled with
curses. Mausoleums, mage towers, haunted forests, cursed weapons of all
kinds... Indeed, Sigmund even saw to it that there was a curse affecting the
entire country. Some years ago, the head of the department of Curses and
Counter-Curses of the Magic University of Siralim began to thoroughly study
Helmholtz's monograph on the creation of the Golems. After decades of
research, he found a way to build a devastating Golem using cursed items and
materials, extracted from different curse-laden places in Rodia. Replicating his
feat is not an easy task, but a Mage of great knowledge and talent has recently
succeeded. The Animatus can absorb and harness the strength of its allies and
become much more dangerous... at a price. Any creature affected by this
ability feels its own strength being taken away, as if part of their being had been
removed. Although the effect is temporary, many creatures who fight alongside
the Animatus start feeling disgusted by it, hating it, or even fearing its very
presence.
