During the funeral of a sovereign of Kaito, a sacred conclave was held in which
all priests and priestesses participated. Through words and a strange dance,
the dust rose from the ground and flew around them.

The Gimp Mummies led the attack on the capital of Kaito. The royal guard was
terrified to realize that, after being hit by these creatures, the wounds they
inflicted with their weapons were reflected in their own bodies.
