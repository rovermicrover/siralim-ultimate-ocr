Cerberus Hellguards are kept as pets by many lords of the Great
Pandemonium. Any subjects that have not been able to fulfill their obligations
become their food. Their jaws are capable of melting flesh because of the
creaturesâ€™ extremely high body temperature. They are also coveted by Rodia's
elite to guard their mansions, so small specimens that can be tamed are sold
at a high price.
