Some Nixes are banished from their towns and cities for serious crimes. Many
look for underground caves to settle alone or with others of their kind who have
also been exiled. Others seek their fortune by working for the less important or
newer crime syndicates. Their methods are usually less orthodox than those of
the other Nixes, and their goals are much more varied. When they carry out a
mission, their success rate is clearly lower and they often make a mess.
