Spellmanes are ferocious, solitary creatures who inhabit very diverse
ecosystems in Rodia. Only during mating season and gestation can two
creatures of this species coexist.

Vulcanar believes the Ashskins give the Great Pandemonium a homely,
welcoming feel. He recommends approaching these creatures calmly,
unarmed if possible, to pet and play with them, as, according to him, they are
tame and friendly with visitors.
