Minotaurs only worship Gonfurian and war itself, and Skullcrushers are the
shamans who fan the flames of tradition with their words and rituals, which
range from dances that would be very picturesque outside a Minotaur tribe, to
sacrifices. Some warriors who face a Minotaur Skullcrusher may think its
weapon is fragile, as it looks like a human skeleton, but in fact it is made of a
heavy metal that can only be found in the Kingdom of Heretics, and
Skullcrushers can break common swords with it.
