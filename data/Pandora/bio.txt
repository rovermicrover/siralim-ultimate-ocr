The energy contained within Mimics is not always stable, and sometimes it
reaches a critical point and escapes outwards, turning them into a Pandora. It
was named by a prestigious, but very old and almost senile, scientist who
witnessed this transformation while studying Mimics. According to him, the
evils of the world had attracted the darkness of this creature, and it would
trigger the end of days.
