Adaxial is Alexandria's right hand, in charge of creating Clockworks and
ensuring Damarel's machinery works properly. Alexandria spent forty years
designing and building this creature, and he is very proud of the result. Unlike
Clockworks, the sound of the gears turning inside Adaxial is imperceptible to
human ears. Adaxial is so attuned to the God of Falsity's realm that it can
detect any problems in its machinery in a sixty mile radius.
