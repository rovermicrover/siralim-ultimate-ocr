The Pandemonium King appears before those who tempt luck without good
intentions. Defeating it is not an easy task, as its body is made of fire and
stone, although it is thought that it is not aggressive to everyone.
Unsurprisingly, only experienced Magi have been able to deal with the creature
and live to tell the tale. A wealthy merchant once said he had brought it to
Rodia and, apparently, it simply went back the way it had come.
