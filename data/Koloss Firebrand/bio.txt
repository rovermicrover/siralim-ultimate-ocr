When a Koloss's puppet is hit by a weapon or a spell, its true, steel body is also
damaged. However, the puppet is not affected by any damage to the blade,
unless, of course, it is completely destroyed.

The fire of the Koloss Firebrand's puppet is generally not deadly, but it is
essential when forging another Koloss. That is why Koloss Firebrands are
respected and even revered within their communities, especially during the
ceremony in which a new Koloss is finally brought to life.
