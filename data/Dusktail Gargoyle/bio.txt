When a Gargoyle senses evil intentions in a creature, it dives to attack without
mercy. However, after the Unification War, other Magi decided to create their
own gargoyles, and at present some attack travelers to steal their belongings
for their masters.

The Dusktail Gargoyle extends its wings to drain the magic power of its
enemies. It digs its tail on the ground to remain static, preventing the force of its
own ability from pushing it away from its targets.
