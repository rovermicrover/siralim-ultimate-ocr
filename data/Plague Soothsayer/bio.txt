Plague Doctors are believed to come from anather dimension. Nothing is
known about their reproductive cycle or their customs, and no one has seen
them sleep or settle anywhere.

Although it has great skill as a doctor, the Plague Soothsayer prefers to prevent
damage rather than repair it. Its main targets are criminal gangs, and it devotes
itself to investigate them and set traps. When the evildoers finally fall, the
Soothsayer gloats as it throws its coin in the air before its terrified victims.
