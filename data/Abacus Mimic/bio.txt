Tired of his students using an abacus behind his back to solve exercises in
class, a math teacher decided to take desperate measures by contacting
someone versed in the art of magic. His salary, unfortunately, did not allow him
to hire the services of an expert, so he decided to search the underworld until
he found someone. After a long haggling session, a price was agreed upon,
and two weeks later that Mage handed the professor a box. He was satisfied,
and opened it in the middle of class with the intention of scaring his students,
saying 'This is what happens when you use an abacus too much, so be
caAAAAAARGH!' The Abacus turned out to be more aggressive and vastly
more dangerous than anticipated, and amid the laughter of his students, the
teacher ran out the door with the Abacus chasing behind him.
