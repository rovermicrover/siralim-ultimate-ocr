The Council of Rodia, concerned about the sudden appearance of these
creatures, is trying to find a way to keep them away from cities.

Wisps can move through inorganic matter, and they use this skill to remain
hidden and undetected. The Laughing Wisp particularly enjoys making use of
this ability, especially at night, in old mansions where few people live. There it
loves to laugh out loud, while moving from wall to wall or entering decorative
oktjects to terrorize the residents and occasionally provoke a heart attack.
