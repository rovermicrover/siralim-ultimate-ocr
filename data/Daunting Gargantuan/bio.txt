Gargantuans are the largest creatures on the planet. They can reach heights of
over 30 feet, but their movements are extremely slow and clumsy.

Daunting Gargantuans were born of the mountains on which humans had once
built mausoleums. When a creature dies in front of one of them, its soul joins
the Gargantuan's temporarily, which greatly increases its strength and speed.
