Ever since humans and other intelligent creatures erected temples in honor of
Surathli, the Holy Crusaders have protected their gates. These creatures,
usually in pairs, remain immobile in front of them for hours, days, or weeks,
until something threatens the temple. Outsiders often confuse them with
statues or simply do not believe the stories, and eventually end up committing
a crime in their eyes.

As soon as a Holy Crusader lifts its mace, it is too late to run away.
