As if having three heads was not enough, the God of Fire decided that the
Apocalypses would not be complete without at least being 10-foot long and
having a tail. They ended up being 15-foot long on average, having two tails
and a pair of claws as sharp as tempered steel. It seems impossible to catch
such a creature by surprise, with so many death threats flailing around, but the
truth is their necks are relatively vulnerable to attacks, a weakness that is
compounded by their having three.
