When a Sparktail reaches maturity, they gain the ability to breathe out of water.
That is why many of these creatures have decided to leave Blue Emerald and
integrate into other societies.

Sparktail Professors are the cornerstone of their community. Even though they
can teach anywhere, their most vital task is to oversee the learning of the
children of their kind, as once they take the Step, there is no turning back. Even
when out of the water, the Professorsâ€™ tails allow them to move small objects
without touching them.
