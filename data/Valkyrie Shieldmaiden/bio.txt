Sigmund was not worried about the Valkyries until, to his surprise, dozens of
them took flight for the first time in history. In a matter of seconds, his ships
began to fall from the skies above Omnia, marking the beginning of the battle
for Rodia's unification. Today, this feat is known as the "Dance of the
Valkyries". The Shieldmaidens served as the vanguard of the Valkyries during
the siege of Omnia. They blocked hundreds of arrows and spells, allowing their
sisters to reach the walls.
