Sparktails are native to the Great Lake of Blue Emerald, at the other end of the
continent where Rodia is located. However, they can also live on the surface
world and perform all kinds of jobs wherever they make their homes.

Sparktail Couriers can move at a brisk pace without resting until nightfall, which
allows them to travel long distances in a very short time. In addition, their tails
act as compasses, allowing them to orient themselves perfectly at all times.
