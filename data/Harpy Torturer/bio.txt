For a time, it was believed that Harpies stole gold and precious stones because
they were attracted to shiny objects. A sailor discovered that in reality they feel
indifference toward these oktjects, as he saw these creatures toss them into the
sea.

rejoice in the suffering of others, cutting skin with their sharp claws and pecking
at the soft parts. Before leaving, they rip the fingers off both hands from their
victims.
