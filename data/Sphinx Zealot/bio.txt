The sovereigns of Kaito ordered their priests and priestesses to go to the towns
and cities and closely observe the Sphinxes to learn more about magic. That
brought great advances to their spells and rituals that culminated in a horrible
curse.

AA Sphinx Zealot befriended a priest of the Empire and instructed him in the art
of magic. It also convinced him that Sphinxes were superior creatures that
should rule the world to bring order and prosperity.
