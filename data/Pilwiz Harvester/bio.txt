To perform any tasks that require fine motor skills, the Pilwiz developed a
series of rudimentary instruments that have been improved by humans over
the years.

Although all Pilwiz handle the harvest, there is one whose work in the field is
limited to it. The Pilwiz Harvester is a nomadic creature that compares the
results of the crops in the different regions of Rodia to assess what the best
products are and advise on subsequent sowings.
