The Great Lake of Blue Emerald is slightly smaller than the whole country of
Rodia. Sparktails have built an entire underwater civilization at the bottom of
the lake, with towns and cities spread across the bed.

Sparktail Searchers are extraordinary miners, as they can see in the dark
without any tools, but mostly because of their tails. They can use their tails to
drill holes in walls quickly and accurately, and also to discern the purity of
nearby minerals.
