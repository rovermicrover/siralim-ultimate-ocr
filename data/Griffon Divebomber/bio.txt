Although Griffons cannot speak like humans and other creatures, they are very
intelligent and form societies of their own.

Any heavy object is a weapon for the Griffon Divebombers, and they always
carry some with them. They fly above their enemies during battle, taking
advantage of any distractions their allies create to drop something on their
heads.
