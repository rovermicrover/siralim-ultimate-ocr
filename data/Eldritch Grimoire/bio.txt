Shortly after becoming the Hidden Grimoire, Cornell started researching the
transmigration that souls undergo after death. Using small rodents as test
sukjects he discovered, among other things, that this phenomenon happens
exactly nine minutes and seven seconds after a living being perishes. His most
notable find, however, was the fact that Spell Gems leave a mark on a soul,
one that remains at the very least throughout the entire process of
transmigration. With great caution he created a Grimoire that was able to
manipulate this magic. He gave it a terrifying appearance, hoping to scare the
looters, but also gave it a personality that would drive it to take care of animals,
trying to make amends for the many creatures that had died for his research.
However, for obvious reasons, animals usually flee in terror at its presence.
