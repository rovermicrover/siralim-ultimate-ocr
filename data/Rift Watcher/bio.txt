Watchers were the first real threat to this world because of their superior
knowledge of magic. When they arrived, they appeared to be playful and
harmless creatures. Some even thought they were a gift from the Gods. But
when their numbers were large enough, they mercilessly attacked the first
human cities and reduced them to ashes and rubble.

Rift Watchers like rocky caves, where they usually join a colony of bats,
sleeping next to them and chasing away their predators.
