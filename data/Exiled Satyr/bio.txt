The constant threat of the Ets forced the Satyrs to establish their colonies high
in the treetops. They prefer leafier, higher trees, and a good part of the Blood
Grove treetops have been settled by them.

Some Satyrs steal from their arachnid neighbors or illegally trade with them.
Those and other crimes are sometimes punished with exile, based on their
severity and the existence of repeat offenses. In addition, to prevent them from
joining anather colony and committing more misdeeds, both horns are cut off.
