Elf Monks are not the only ones who make the decision to fight without
weapons. Some Elves learn to use their entire bodies as weapons and become
Elf Brawlers. Every few months they organize a traditional tournament in which
only these Elves fight in single combat to win the Belt of Purple Leaves. Of
course, there is no betting on these matches, as the practice is banned in Elf
lands.
