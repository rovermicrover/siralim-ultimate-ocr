This terrifying creature dwells in the seafloor of the east Rodian seas.
Advances in the field of magic have long allowed it to walk on the surface
without drowning or exploding into a thousand pieces due to the pressure
differences between the two environments. It is very patient and can spend
hours, even days, lurking in the darkness while waiting for a fish to run into one
of its terrible pincers. However, this technique is useless on the surface, so it
will wait and wait without any prey approaching it until it starves.
