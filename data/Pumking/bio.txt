Despite its threatening appearance, the Pumking does not enjoy fighting, and
prefers to play practical jokes on the people around it. If, despite that, a Mage is
determined to make this creature part of their team, having a considerable
amount of sweets in their pantry is usually enough to keep its eccentricities at
bay. Otherwise, they may wake up the next morning to find all their clothes
replaced with bags of manure.
