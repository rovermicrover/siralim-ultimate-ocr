In the heyday of Omnian civilization, the capital's Institute of Magical Research,
under Sigmund's orders, brought to life extraordinary creatures named
Amphisbaena to improve the quality of life of the kingdom's inhabitants.

Some Amphisbaena were born with an innate ability to resolve conflicts. Their
greatest purpose is believed to have been to serve the kingdom for diplomatic
purposes, but there is no evidence to confirm this theory. Many became
psychologists at schools, large companies, unions or in their own offices.
However, the best known and most beloved of their community were the
Amphisbaena Arbitrators, thanks to their flawless performance and tireless fight
for their rights.
