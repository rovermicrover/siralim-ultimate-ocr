When two Wolpertingers of different subspecies mate, half of the litter
resembles the mother and the other half resembles the father. The Vernal
Wolpertinger is the only one of its kind that carries its litter while hunting. On its
own it has no magical power whatsoever, but when the whole family is together
its skin emits a powerful multi-colored glow and becomes as tough as heavy
armor.
