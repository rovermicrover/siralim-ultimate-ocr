The Forsaken are insatiable creatures that feed mainly on human flesh. Like
Ghouls, they have lost their minds and identities and have become tireless
killers that only steel and magic can stop.

The last battle of the Unification War caused serious damage to the city of
Omnia. It was soon on fire, and the women who died by the flames became
Scourgewalkers. When they find people, they turn the fire of their own bady into
spells to end their lives.
