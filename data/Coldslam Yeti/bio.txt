The Coldslam Yeti is one of Azural's own favorite works. Like the rest of the
Yetis, it prefers to live in high mountains covered with snow and ice, although
its thick fur allows it to adapt to almost any environment. These creatures can
summon blizzards when they get angry, and even turn summer into a terrible
winter for an entire city, which is why the authorities no longer allow them entry.
