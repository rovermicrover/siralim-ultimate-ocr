During the years leading up to the Brownie Rebellion, some of them secretly
tried to learn magic, although this was never their strong suit. The day this
enslaved species took up arms, many performed a dangerous ritual with the
purpose of merging into a single and powerful being. As expected, it didn't work
out. A dimensional portal appeared above them and forcibly led them to
another world. For centuries they remained in that place lost in time, with
countless stars in the black velvet of its eternal night. Recently, two great
Rodian Magi encountered these creatures and informed them not only that the
Brownies were successful in their rebellion, but also that they were in Eternity's
End, the realm ruled by Vertraag, God of Time. The failed ritual had changed
them, and after so many generations they had learned to use a strange power
based on the accumulation of gravity under their hoods. The two Magi led
these creatures to Rodia, and most of them now live a simple life.
