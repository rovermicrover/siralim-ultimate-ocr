The Ancient Arachnalisk owes its name to the fact that it usually lives in ancient
temples and cities, forgotten places that have been uninhabited for centuries. It
knows every inch of its home and expertly plays with lights and shadows,
making its web undetectable for most. It is also able to pinpoint the precise
location of its prey and even assess its strength based on the intensity of the
pulls.
