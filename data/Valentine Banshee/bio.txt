The Banshees that were born closest to Erebyss did so as Valentine Banshees
because of her pain. They are unique creatures that go from town to town
guided by love. But not the real kind. A Valentine Banshee looks for people who
share their lives with someone who just wants to take advantage of them.
When one such couple is asleep, this creature places its hands on their
foreheads and exchanges their feelings towards each other.
