The Asura are an ancient tribe that lives and dies in battle. These creatures
shook the foundations of human civilization a thousand years after the Watcher
War.

Before entering battle, Asura Blooddrinkers perform a ritual that culminates
with the sacrifice of a creature. For the next twenty-four hours, anyone who was
present in the ritual can regenerate their wounds by feeding on the blood of
their enemies.
