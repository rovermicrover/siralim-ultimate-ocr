During the Brownie rebellion, a large number of Brownies used Warhogs as
mounts.

No other Warhog can camouflage itself better than the Oozing Warhog. It can
go unnoticed even when it is right next to a person, but it generally stays still
and waits for its would-be hunter to leave before running away.
