Phase Warriors obey the will of the Mage who gave them life, until after a few
hours that person heart's stops. From that point on, they will follow any master.

Phase Marauders are the remnants of the mercenaries that Sigmund hired to
besiege the city of Siralim at the end of the Unification War. He took the Queen
by surprise in this way, as his main army was in Omnia. These creatures are
skilled with all weapons, although they prefer melee combat.
