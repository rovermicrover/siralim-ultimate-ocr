Phoenixes are majestic, elusive creatures that rarely interact with other beings.

It is said that in the past, a Royal Phoenix fell seriously ill and landed on the
Frostbite Caverns. Azural approached full of curiosity and watched as the
creature burst into flames and was consumed. The young God knelt and
carefully put his hand in its ashes. He felt the touch of two tiny legs and a gentle
peck. Surprised, he pushed the ashes away and looked at the Frost Phoenix
chick he had accidentally created.
