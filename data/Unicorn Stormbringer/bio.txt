The Unicorn Stormbringer owes its name to the fact that it was once believed
to attract bad weather. When it rains, it trots merrily and rolls on the ground
next to its kind, enjoying the touch of the damp grass caressing its coat. During
a war, some Stormbringers go to the cities and protect civilians from the spells
that fly everywhere through the streets.
