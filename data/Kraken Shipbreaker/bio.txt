The ocean is teeming with sea creatures that Krakens can feed on, which is
why a Rodian scientist theorized centuries ago that Krakens only attacked
Radian ships for fun. However, in reality, only Kraken Shipbreakers do this, and
not for fun, but because large ships scare away the prey on which they feed.
Today, ships are equipped with a state-of-the-art magical device that mitigates
the vibrations produced when sailing, so these Krakens are no longer a
problem on high sea routes.
