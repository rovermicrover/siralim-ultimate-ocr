The Apis used to have magic powers that influenced weather and fertility.
However, the Sphinx Usurper and its closest associates used the power of the

The protrusion between the horns of the Protector is sold at a high price as a
good-luck charm, as these creatures are immune to curses. The amulets,
however, lack this property.
