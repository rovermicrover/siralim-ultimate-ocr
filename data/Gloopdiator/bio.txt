Venedon spent hundreds of years trying to bring the Concoctions to life, but

It is plain to see that the Gloopdiator knows very well what it is doing. It
employs elaborate tactics such as feints in battle, and it learns from its own

body. Then, the Gloopdiator strikes its enemy's head, dropping its mace on
their skull.
