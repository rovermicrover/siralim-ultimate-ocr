The number of Revenants that live underwater is unknown. However, several
studies financed by the government of Omnia centuries ago determined that
their population easily doubled that of surface creatures.

The Revenant Captain's shield is a powerful artifact that is rarely used for
protection. Learning how to wield it requires a lot of effort and training for
several years. With practice, the wielder can channel the pain from its wounds
to deliver devastating blows on its enemies.
