Dragan tutored Ainsworth while she was a student, and he conducted
numerous investigations. Among other things, he studied the void through the
Voidlords. His findings led him to believe these creatures are the void itself,
poured into the universe through the cracks the Watchers used to slip into this
world. According to his hypothesis, the Watchers came from a dimension
without matter, and when they slipped through the cracks, they involuntarily
adapted to the laws of physics in our world.

Touching an Imperial Voidlord is even more dangerous than touching the
others, as even if someone manages to get away before being erased, their
mind is assaulted by delusions and feelings of impending doom that often lead
to suicide.
