There are many species of lizards in the world, however, all of them come from
a single one that existed even before the Gods shaped the continents and
oceans. It is fast and elusive, able to blend into any environment. Although the
rest of its species evolved to become less dangerous when they adapted to
their environment, some of them remained in their original form due to the
extreme conditions that occur on the island of Bieiros, the only place in the
world in which the First Spawns can be found in the wild.
