Although Basilisks are much larger than humans, they have learned not to pick
a fight with them. Still, showing fear in front of these creatures often means
becoming their prey.

According to a legend, the Spitting Basilisk is a rare specimen that, in addition
to emitting a powerful scream, releases a substance that causes death on
contact with the skin. This, like many other legends, is false. Its saliva, in fact,
has powerful healing and analgesic properties.
