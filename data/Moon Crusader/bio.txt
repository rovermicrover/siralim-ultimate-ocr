When this creature's mace hits the body of its enemies, the opaque sphere on
its head absorbs all light around it. For a moment, darkness falls and
uncertainty reigns. The Moon Crusader is a warrior of light who travels the
world in search of forgotten magic that continues to overflow and could cause
disasters. Using the power of its two spheres, it can absorb this energy and
contain the magic items that emit it... or simply destroy them with its incredible
strength.
