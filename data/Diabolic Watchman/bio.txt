The Diabolic Watchman is the Horde's greatest expert in melee combat. It can
skillfully wield any weapon and it helps train its comrades-in-arms to improve
their physical abilities. It follows a strict training regimen from a young age that
only a few of its kind are able to endure. Few of its enemies forget the powerful
blows of its mace... if they live to tell about it.
