This creature is not really a Phoenix, but an automaton programmed by the
Auditors to eliminate any outsider who manages to break through the barrier
surrounding the city of Ubi Concordia. Its flight is as deft as that of other
Phoenixes, but its call is metallic, high-pitched, and extremely unpleasant. The
energy released by its wings and tail damages both organic tissue and stone or
metal, and it can exhale bursts of it through its jaws when it enters combat.
