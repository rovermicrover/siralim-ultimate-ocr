Blizzards and frosts inspire fear and respect throughout the world. In the dawn
of civilization, humans began to worship a God who did not exist. They
implored him to placate the snowstorms and the cold, but their words were not
heard. However, after the Watcher War, magic was unleashed for the first time
on a scale that had never been seen before. And so, Azural opened his eyes
on top of a frozen mountain. He never helps with the cold, but he enjoys
watching travelers face its adversities.
