And the big day finally arrived. Everything was in place to start the process of
duplicating the Nether Orbs. Several rooms linked by endless spells, strange
liquids bubbling in cauldrons and test tubes, and hundreds of Magi arranged
throughout the Refuge, ready to do their part. Ainsworth was at point 0,
surrounded by nine Nether Orbs of great power. She grabbed her staff and
began the experiment. But something went wrong. Very wrong. The Nether
Orbs rose and a powerful magical current vibrated throughout the tower. A
tower whose space had been altered. The ritual disfigured her, stole her sanity
and turned her disciples into strange copies of herself.
