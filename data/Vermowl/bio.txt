Vermowils do not seem to realize they are not ordinary owls, and often cannot
supress their instinct to go hunt in the woods. As with Woodkas, owners of
these creatures must periodically check them for any food they may have
swallowed and remove it from inside their bodies. Predictably, Vermowls are
more active at night, and can even break windows if they are not allowed to go
outside for a while, unsupervised. Some mercenaries have already noticed this
and tried to hunt them down. However, these creatures are aware of their
ability to get other living beings drunk, so they always manage to slip away,
leaving behind a group of people babbling incoherently on the floor, unable to
move.
