The Uraloses are native to an island east of Neralim, called Hutika. This island
is rich in resources, and has been the target of attacks by pirates, adventurers,
and even the kingdoms of Rodia.

Only Uralos Spellslingers who have undergone strict training since childhood
can become Healers. Furthermore, their devotion to Surathli must be
unshakable, as must the vow of poverty they will endure for the rest of their
lives.
