Not all Shapeshifters develop their potential. Some dedicate themselves to
routine tasks, and only develop their power enough to protect themselves from
the inclemencies of the weather.

From a very young age, Nature Shapeshifters prefer to transform into trees and
plants to feel in harmony with nature. When they reach a certain skill with their
powers, they fly over the forests, meadows and swamps of Radia in the form of
a bird or an insect.
