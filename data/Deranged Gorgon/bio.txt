The Gorgons come from distant islands, and they fled to Radia to save
themselves from the genocide ordered by an evil human empress that ruled
over an entire continent. They are social creatures and enjoy city life, but their
appearance and their abilities instill fear wherever they go.

The Deranged are Gorgons who have suffered traumatic events and have
become extremely aggressive. Their gaze is so intense that they can leave
anyone who looks into their eyes petrified in fear.
