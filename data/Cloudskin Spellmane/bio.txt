A Spellmane's subspecies does not depend on its parents, but on the
ecosystem in which it was gestated.

Cloudskins were the first Spellmanes, and they can usually be found in the
Azure Dream, their place of origin. It is very common for these creatures to
hide in the clouds, waiting for prey to get close enough. The humans of old,
back before they inhabited the world, developed creative strategies to avoid
their attacks and hunt them down with nets and rudimentary spears.
