Sanctuses are considered a divine punishment by the people of Rodia;
terrifying beings that inspire a much greater fear than Sins or even Banshees.

Without a doubt, the worst punishment of all is inflicted by the Patientias
Sanctus. Those who are unable to control their anger turn into hybrid trees that
take root, condemned to remain motionless for hundreds of years without
losing their cognitive functions or their impulses.
