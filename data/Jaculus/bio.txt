Jaculuses are not native to Rodia. They belong to a harsh ecosystem found in
the mountains east of Yarthe, the northernmost country on the continent where
both nations are. They are small, but fast and fierce. In fact, they hardly ever
bite or claw at their prey, instead striking with their whole bodies at high speed
to kill them. Currently, some mercenaries and bounty hunters in Rodia keep
these creatures as companions, though a permit is required, and releasing
them is forbidden, as it could destabilize many of the country's ecosystems.
