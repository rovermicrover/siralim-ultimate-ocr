Hundreds of miles north of Rodia there is a small underground kingdom, ruled
by creatures who can see in the dark, and who dig tunnels with their strong,
sharp claws. Although from the beginning of time they were known in what
would later become Rodia as the Skyless, they are now called Obscene Blight
because of an event that took place when the Asura tried to conquer their
kingdom hundreds of years ago. They simply dug tunnels in such a way that
the earth would collapse as the enemy army walked on it, rushing them to their
deaths. Most of these creatures are peaceful and do business with other
kingdoms, and there are still those who say that somewhere in their domains
lies a treasure like no other.
