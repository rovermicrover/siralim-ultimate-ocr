The long tail of a Manticore is a dangerous weapon. However, the poison of its
stinger is only deadly to humans. No other Manticore handles its tail with such
ease as the Manticore Conqueror. Those who have fought one agree that its
tail moves as if it was alive, as if it could foresee its enemy's movements,
dodge blows and attack at just the right moment while the creature bites and
tears at another target.
