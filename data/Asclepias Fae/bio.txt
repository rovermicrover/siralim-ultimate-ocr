In the middle of the desert known as the Bronze Sea, there is a huge, lush tree
that is not affected by the extreme temperatures in its environment. It is known
as Yataka.

The Asclepias Fae, like many of its kind, leaves behind it a trail in the color of
its wings while flying. However, this Fae can use that trail to distract its enemies
by creating a whirlwind of color as it flutters at high speed, confusing them or
even hiding its presence.
