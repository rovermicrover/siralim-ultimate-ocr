Unlike Angels, the Unguided can hesitate when choosing a target, as they take
time to judge the severity of the actions that, in their opinion, deserve
punishment. It was for this reason that Erebyss and Surathli created the
Angels, perfect killing machines for whom good and evil mean nothing.

The Unguided Judge received its name because ancient humans and other
creatures believed it never inflicted any punishment. Soon after, they
discovered that those touched by them on the forehead for ten seconds quickly
lost the ability to speak and developed small appendages on their backs. Over
time, these appendages became wings, and their entire bodies and minds
changed until they fully became Unguided.
