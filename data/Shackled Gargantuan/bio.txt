When Torun was creating the Gargantuans, he used his power indiscriminately
over different mountains. One of them was cursed, and this creature was born.
It woke up full of unbridled rage and began to destroy everything in its path.
Torun was disappointed, as it is not necessary to kill mortals to humiliate them.
However, he also felt pity. He finally decided to chain it and leave it hidden,
hoping that it would change its attitude over time. It only took two days for him
to forget about it.
