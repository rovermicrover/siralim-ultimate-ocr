Stag Guardians used to live in closed forests before undergoing their
transformation, after which many of them dispersed. They earned their name
by keeping threats to their home at bay, from natural disasters to enemy
creatures that want to take advantage of the forest's resources. They have
been seen cooperating with Moss Golems and Ents to face especially
dangerous threats.
