Cave Cockatrices are an Arachnalisk's greatest enemy, as no other creature
devours as many eggs from these arachnids. Since they generally inhabit dark
places such as caves or underground tunnels, they lost their sight in favor of
very acute senses of hearing and smell, as well as a sixth sense that allows
them to locate sources of heat around them through receptors on their
featherless skin. The council of Rodia legalized breeding these creatures to
eliminate Arachnalisk infestations.
