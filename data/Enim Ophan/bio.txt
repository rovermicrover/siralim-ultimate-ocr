Yseros knew that the size and shape of Watchers, as well as their ability to fly,
made them especially lethal as spellcasters. The first human biologists who
studied Ophans discovered that, despite their intelligence, they do not have the
biological support to move or to think. It was three centuries later, when magic
became part of the scientific method, that another biologist found that the ring
around their body has a magical circuit that emulates the usual structures of
other living beings.
