On rare occasions, Dawn Crusaders let other creatures ride on them. There is
a legend about four riders that lived great adventures on the backs of these
creatures and saved a distant kingdom from the tyranny of the powerful
X-Mage. The story of the Warriors of Dawn is also famous for being an
impeccable satire of the genre, and it has been translated into more than 140
different languages throughout the world.
