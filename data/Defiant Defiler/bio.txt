Although it looks like two different creatures, the Defiant Defiler has a single
mind. As night falls, a piercing scream escapes from its jaws. The time has
come to claim a victim. For hundreds of years it frightened several towns and
villages of what would later be known as Rodia, until a forest ranger discovered
that it attacks any humanoid form, regardless of whether it is alive. Once eaten,
the creature returns to its lair and does not return until the following night. This
is why even today the outskirts of many towns in Radia are littered with
scarecrows.
