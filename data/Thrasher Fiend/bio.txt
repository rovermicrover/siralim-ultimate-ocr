Their terrifying, demon-like appearance, their tirelessness, and their voracious
hunger have given the Fiends a bad reputation. However, if they are trained
from a young age and fed pieces of meat instead of living creatures, they will
never devour their masters or other beings even if they are starving.

The wings of the Thrasher Fiend do not allow it to fly, but when it charges
against an enemy or prey, it can flutter around for a few seconds, making it
easier for it to take additional bites.
