Some people believe the existence of Rift Dancers is linked to the Gods' role in
the creation of this world, but the legendary Mage Milner, originally from
Vanelin, disproved this claim by finding a correlation between the number of
Rift Dancer appearances and the bloodiest battles in the Unification War.

Aerum Rift Dancers appear mostly in high mountains, looking for strong air
currents with which to travel from one peak to another, perhaps yearning for
some peculiarity of their place of origin.
