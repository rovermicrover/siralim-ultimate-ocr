When the rest of the Yetis freeze an enemy, this creature utters a guttural roar
and charges with all its might in that direction. The spikes on its shoulders can
pierce and break ice no matter how thick it is, causing serious injuries that, in
the best of cases, leave the enemy unable to keep fighting. This is a useful skill
when foraging, as there are many creatures trapped in the ice of the Frostbite
Caverns that the Snowsting Yeti can easily extract.
