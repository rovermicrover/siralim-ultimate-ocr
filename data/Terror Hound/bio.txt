Hound communication is a subtle, but infallible system. They use sound, the
location of the rest of the pack, and the movement of their prey to know exactly
what to do at any given time.

A Mage carried out a prcject in the basements of the Refuge of the Magi,
focusing on the mystical union that makes these creatures so dangerous. After
many years, he created the Terror Hound, a being who can merge with its pack
in very specific circumstances, giving a literal meaning to the expression that
best defines them: we are all one.
