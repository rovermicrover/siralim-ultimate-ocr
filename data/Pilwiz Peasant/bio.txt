When a Pilwiz reaches 7 years of age, the blades of its feet and hands begin to
develop. At 10 they are considered independent adults, and their blades reach
their maximum size.

Pilwiz Peasants are the most numerous of their species, and the ones in
charge of cultivating the fields. Many thieves underestimate their strength for
this reason, but they are as dangerous as any other Pilwiz, especially in single
combat, and they protect the fruit of their efforts with their own lives.
