This creature is as old as the world and its origin is a mystery. It rules over the
sea-dwelling Dragons that never come to the surface, although there is an
ancient orb capable of summoning it and its armies if the cause is worthy of its
presence. Some historians fear that eventually rulers of Siralim, who often
interact with Nether Orbs, will corrupt the one that would summon this terrible
creature, and add it to Siralim's hosts.
