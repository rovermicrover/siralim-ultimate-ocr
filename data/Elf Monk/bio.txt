Only an Elf beyond the age of 300 can aspire to become a true Monk. Not
using weapons is part of their path, as they believe nature must be preserved
intact, without a single scratch, and belongings are but a weight for the body.
Therefore, their only food is the energy that the forest itself wishes to grant
them. Despite their radical views, Monks do not impase their beliefs on others,
and they are treated with veneration.
