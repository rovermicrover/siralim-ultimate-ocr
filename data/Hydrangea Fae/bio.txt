The magic that protects Yataka prevents it from taking any damage from
blows, cuts, or spells. Indeed, not even a God could harm it. However, a study
conducted recently at the Magic University of Vanelin established that a force
powerful enough could destroy it. The Hydrangea Fae's wings glow in the dark,
so they have a much harder time making a surprise attack at night. For this
reason, they tend to hide in the leafy treetops, plummeting from the heights on
their enemies.
