From the Unguided's point of view, entering Sanctum Umbra is a serious
transgression that must be punished with death. However, death is not the only
sentence these creatures carry out. Sometimes it is enough to simply hang the
offender upside down from a tree for three days, or to gently place them on the
top of a snowy mountain.

The Unguided Desecrator only inflicts physical punishment, which generally
means crushing the limbs of its victims under the weight of its powerful legs.
