Helmholtz discovered that the gem in the crown of a Paragon is the focus of its
aura, and their body loses all color if it is removed. However, the gem itself has
no power unless it is placed on their foreheads. After Helmholtz's fight with
Sigmund, the Amethyst Paragon asked him for its freedom, and he refused.
However, when the Unicorn Firewalker caught him by surprise and ended his
life, this creature managed to escape before Milner arrived to revive him with
her Undolim Seraph.
