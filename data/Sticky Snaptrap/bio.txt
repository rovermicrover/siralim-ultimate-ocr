One of the most spectacular shows in the world occurs during the night in
Eferia, when Snaptraps expel part of the residual energy of the creatures they
have devoured. That is, when they expel their "memories".

Fights between Snaptraps take place from time to time, usually because of a
dispute over prey, but they are rarely fatal for any of the opponents.

The Sticky Snaptrap uses the suckers on its branches to stick to tree trunks
and surprise its prey from unexpected angles. Usually, it does not move from
the trunk and uses its sticky branches to catch very small animals and bring
them to its mouth, but if larger prey passes under it, it drops and coils to devour
it.
