He was the scourge of the icy mountains near Sithicus long before Misery,
Egas and other dark lords even existed. When the blizzards lifted snow and
frost from the ground, he fell on his enemies wrapped in a blanket of cold white
and blood red. It was believed that Azural had sent him to cover the entire
kingdom in ice. However, the Queen of Sithicus foresaw his movements and
managed to sabotage his descent by provoking a huge avalanche. Now, he
and his castle belong to the Kingdom of Heretics.
