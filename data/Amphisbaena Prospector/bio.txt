The protests of the citizens of Omnia against the Amphisbaenas grew, and the
Amphisbaenas brought several unions to trial, accusing them of inciting crimes
against their species. Sigmund finally took sides, and decreed that continuing
the hunt of these creatures would be punished with exile to the Torture
Chamber, whatever the crime committed against them.

Amphisbaena Prospectors perform a wide variety of physical tasks, but they
are best known for mining inside the gigantic Nether Orb on which the capital of
Siralim was built, with the aim of extracting the raw material used to make Spell
Gems. Due to the power it contains, most creatures eventually become ill, but
Amphisbaenas are immune ta this influence thanks to their biology.
