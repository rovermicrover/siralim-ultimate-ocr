Maniacs are creatures that live in a small peninsula surrounded by an almost
impassable desert beyond Ahruna.

The Armored Maniac is nothing more than a Maniac Builder trained to
demolish the wooden walls of neighboring tribes. Before going into battle, it
wallows in a pool of mud and blood, preferably from its enemies.
