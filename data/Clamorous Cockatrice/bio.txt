Cockatrices are exotic birds that for centuries have inspired a multitude of
stories in the different cultures of Rodia, specially regarding their origin.

Clamorous Cockatrices had to survive in the Cutthroat Jungle. Imitating a wide
variety of sounds helps them drive away predators, attract prey, and trick other
creatures into hunting for them so they can eat both hunter and prey.
