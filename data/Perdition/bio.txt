Vyre was the most skilled blademaster in Ankor, the country closest to Rodia.
His older sister, Sevalah, taught him the secrets of magic, and together they
protected the country from the hordes of the Great Pandemonium, who wanted
to destroy the church of Surathli that was so widespread in those lands. Vyre
had a calm demeanor and enjoyed meditating, unlike his sister, who spent all
her free time reading or investigating the mysteries of magic and the universe
itself. When the Auditors contacted them, Vyre flatly refused to belong to such
an organization, but after a long night talking to his sister, he accepted the offer
on the condition that they helped them destroy the enemies of Ankor. The
Auditors replied that the war would be long, and its outcome uncertain, were it
not for the fact that the organization had already begun to intervene a long time
ago. After joining them, Vyre was given the codename Dawn, and his sister
Sevalah was Gloom. Their first mission along with the other four members of
their group consisted, precisely, in thwarting the Great Pandemonium's plans
for these lands. Twelve years later, Vyre became Perdition and created the
Sanctum Umbra.
