There are many legends surrounding the world's oceans. They speak of
curses, great treasures and unexplored lands. The story of the Fog Spirit goes
back to that of William James, a famous pirate who sailed the waters for
decades and discovered impossible places. His last journey took him to an
island that floated above the northern sea, where he found a magnificent
treasure. A cursed treasure. The Fog Spirit appeared when this happened, and
it has traveled the world since, breaking minor curses.
