Snaptraps lived only on the island of Eferia, but James and his crew brought
with them a good number of seeds which they soon used to trade in Radia, as
they usually do.

A group of Rodian scientists crossed Snaptrap seeds with other local plants
and managed to create a hybrid between a Battrap and various fruit-bearing
shrubs. The so-called Snaptrap Cultivar feeds on insects and attacks larger
animals when they try to pluck their fruit before it is ripe. Their attacks can be
deadly, but once the fruit is ripe it drops on its own and the Cultivar Snaptrap
stops responding aggressively if someone tries to get ahold of it.
