The physical strength of the Forsaken is immense. With their pincers, they can
stop the fist of a Giant and cut off its hand.

At the beginning of a fight, the Spinewhipper uses her tentacles to stimulate her
own spine with electric currents, increasing her speed considerably. She then
uses her spine to hit her enemies in the face or grab them by the arms so that
they cannot use their weapons.
