An ambitious prcject was carried out in the Columbia Tower to give life to
inanimate objects. Grimoires are the result of a long and tedious experiment
whose purpose was to create singular and extraordinary spells that would be
preserved for eternity.

Anyone who opens the Faded Grimoire without taking the necessary
precautions will see their lifespan reduced every second.
