Harpy nests have always been a target for humans and other intelligent
creatures. The guards who are stationed day and night on town walls and
guard posts always keep a watchful eye for the arrival of these creatures.

The Harpy Screamer constantly emits a shuddering shriek. Anyone who hears
it up close risks losing their mind for a few seconds. For this reason, Harpy
hunters can be recognized by the earplugs that always hang around their necks.
