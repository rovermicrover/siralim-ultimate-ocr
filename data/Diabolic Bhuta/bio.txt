Also known as Supreme Leader by the members of the Diabolic Horde, it is
believed to be an emissary of Gonfurian, charged with spreading chaos
throughout the land. Only the Diabolic Commanders have seen it, which is why
it was thought to be a legend for a long time. However, it seems that he now
wants to personally oversee his plans for the Horde, since there have been
numerous reported sightings of it recently.
