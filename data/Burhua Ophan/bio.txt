The Ophans were born from the efforts of Surathli and Yseros to prevent their
creation from being destroyed.

The Burhua Ophan offers excellent support in battle. During the Watcher
incident, it helped Surathli's faithful cast more powerful spells. To produce this
effect, it rotates the ring around its body at high speeds, so that its magical
energy is shared with the spellcasters around it.
