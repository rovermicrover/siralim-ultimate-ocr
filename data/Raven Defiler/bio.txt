Ravens learned to use magic before humans. At first, they did not share that
knowledge for fear of being invaded. It was not until the construction of the
Refuge of the Magi that these creatures began to cooperate with humans.

The Raven Defiler carries around a human skull and spine for a reason. They
are against the supremacy of humans and often try to convince their kind and
other creatures to cause problems for them.
