Elves feed on leaves, roots and fruit, never harming other creatures in the
process. Therefore, an Elf Huntsman does not hunt animals, but intruders, or
as they call them: "Utter fools" or "Insolent creatures who think they don't need
an invitation to enter our domains and sully them with their disrespectful
customs”. Elf Huntsmen are the fastest and most skilled. They jump among the
branches and hide in the leafy trees to remain undetected before they fall on
their enemies and end their lives.
