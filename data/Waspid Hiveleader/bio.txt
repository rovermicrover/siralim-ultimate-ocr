The people of Radia exterminated Waspid hives without control, so the
authorities banned such activities under penalty of imprisonment.

Waspid Hiveleaders have the decisive voice in the Waspid armies, both when
attacking and when defending the hive. They help coordinate the actions of the
other Waspids with their buzzes, movements and pheromones, turning them
into a single warrior that dances a deadly dance.
