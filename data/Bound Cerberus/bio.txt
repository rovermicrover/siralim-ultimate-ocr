Vulcanar soon regretted creating this creature. Even the Elemental King
himself could not control it. In its first minutes of life it pounced on every
creature it could find and tore them apart with its jaws on its way to the surface,
where it continued the carnage. For several weeks it terrorized the people of
Rodia, until, in a stroke of luck for the country, it encountered the Eternal
Divinity. After a fierce battle, the Demigod vanquished the beast and left it
somewhere no one could find it.
