The life expectancy of an Abomination is usually under ten years due to their
poor state of health, which they do not notice because Tartarith removed their
ability to feel pain. On one occasion, a Bile Abomination vomited on another
that was still in progress. One would think the God of Torture would have left it
to die slowly, but he was feeling creative that day, so he fixed the damage.
Using pieces of cloth from here and there, Tartarith covered the corroded skin
of the creature, sewing them to its flesh with very clumsy technique. However,
the hands of a God had touched the rags and unknowingly imbued his creation
with extraordinary resilience.
