The Goddess of Illusion is wise and powerful, always watching over the world.
Like some other Gods, she wants humans and creatures to live in harmony.
When the world is in danger, Yseros is always the first to notice, and she
sometimes mobilizes the rest of the Gods to help protect it. Yseros gathered
the Gods to act against the tyranny of an old ruler of Siralim. She suggested
Milner as their heroine, but, as usual, Vertraag got his own way and the then
ruler of Nex was chosen instead.
