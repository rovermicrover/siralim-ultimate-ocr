Lizardmen coexist with humans and other intelligent species in many villages
of Rodia and in all its cities. Their magical abilities, in general, are more than
questionable, but some manage to develop certain skills that are useful for
combat after arduous training that only a few are able to complete. Many of
them are in the service of Rodia's army, others simply use their powers to
make their daily tasks easier, and some decide to go on adventures. However,
there are also those who join criminal gangs, usually to extort and loot
regardless of who suffers for it.
