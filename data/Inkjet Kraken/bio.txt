The Revenants have always been busy fighting each other, but in the past
many of their peoples temporarily united to confront the Krakens.

Some Krakens feel curious about the surface, especially Inkjet Krakens, who
find the warmth of the sun on their head and tentacles pleasant and very
relaxing. When humans and other intelligent creatures took to the sea, armed
with weapons and magic, these creatures became endangered. Those who
could shoot the most ink were the ones with the highest chances of survival, so
nowadays, thanks to evolution, no one can find them after they release it.
