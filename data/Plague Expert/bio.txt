The first known appearance of the Plague Expert dates to the quarantine of
Andolin, but no one really knows for how long it had been traveling the world
before that. While its people cured the sick, the Expert wrote strange symbols
in its book that no one recognized. The presence of this creature is now a
beacon of hope, and it lifts the spirits of the people wherever it goes. Moreover,
it is believed that its book contains the supreme knowledge of medicine, and
many long to learn its secrets.
