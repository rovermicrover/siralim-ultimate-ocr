Vortices were the first to help the world in the Watcher War, stopping their
advance in a series of decisive actions at the cost of thousands of Vortex
casualties.

While Aeolian was designing one of his Vortices, Torun decided to visit him to
make sure he was doing his job right. When he saw the Vortices, he frowned
and said: "YOUR !@#8$ING CREATURES ARE WEAK. LET ME IMPROVE
THIS PIECE OF !@#$." He then threw a Raving Storm at the incomplete
Vortex, which fused with it to form the Untamed Vortex.
