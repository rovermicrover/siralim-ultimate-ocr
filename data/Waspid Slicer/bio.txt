A Waspid queen's activities are mostly limited to eating, laying eggs and
deciding what its progeny will become. It is rarely seen outdoors, and to date,
none have attacked a human being or any other type of intelligent creature.

The poison of the Waspid Slicer has magical properties that increase the
potency of the poison of its sisters. After they insert their stinger, they flutter
with great strength to tear their enemy's body with it.
