The jaws of an Ossein are merely decorative, as they do not need to feed at all.
Early research on these creatures indicates that they are very similar to
Golems.

The Titan's blood is extremely hot, but this does not seem to affect the
Osseins, perhaps because they come from the same entity. The Bloody
Ossein was imbued with this blood at birth, which always remains in its body
thanks to the power of Mortem. This allows the creature to control other
Osseins and organize them for joint attacks.
