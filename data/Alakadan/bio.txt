Alakadan is the eternal companion of Yllor, and both of them have guarded the
gates to the Refuge of the Magi side by side since its construction. When the
city of Vanelin was besieged in a conflict, they fought together with the Red Hat
order against the army of Siralim. The kingdom of Vanelin fell in the end, but
Alakadan and Yllor managed to escape and return to Zonte, only to discover
that their home had also been taken over by the ruler of Siralim. When Yllor
learned of this, Alakadan had to paralyze him with the poison of his sting to
prevent him from attacking without first assessing his possibilities. After
convincing him that his plan, or lack thereof, was suicide, they agreed to split
up to ask for help in liberating the different kingdoms and realms from the
tyranny of the invaders.
