It is said that the Bards were born of songs and verses, of art and creativity.
The truth is that, to a certain extent, this statement is correct.

The Bard Balladeer's songs are full of love and tenderness. When two people
who are attracted to each other listen to this creature's music, they are
enraptured by an intense romantic feeling that pushes them to kiss.
