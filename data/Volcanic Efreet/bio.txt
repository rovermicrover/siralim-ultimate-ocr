Efreets are able to speak, but their vocabulary is not very extensive, limited to
short sentences that often include pyromaniac threats and manifestations of
their contempt towards Djinns.

Tracking a Volcanic Efreet is very easy, due to the lava that constantly drips
from its body. Naturally, Magi who have these creatures under their command
should take preventive measures so that their home is not reduced to a pile of
ash and molten rock.
