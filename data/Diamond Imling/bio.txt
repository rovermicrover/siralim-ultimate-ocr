When an Imler egg is exposed to magic for a certain amount of time, its
development changes and it is born as an Imling. Imlings are fertile, but their
eggs produce Imlers unless the process is repeated.

The magical qualities of the Diamond Imling are exceptional among its kind. In
the words of a Mage named Spielrein, who studied them for some time, "it's as
if magic danced around them and wanted to obey their orders."
