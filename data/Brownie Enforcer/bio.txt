Many humans took the Brownie's side during their rebellion. However, when
everything was over, most of these creatures left the cities, not wanting to have
anything to do with humans anymore.

Some Brownies work for crime syndicates, offering their services as hired
killers for a cheaper fee than the Nixes. Their small size is ideal for entering
homes and dealing with their targets without attracting attention, and they are
sometimes as efficient as the hired killers par excellence.
