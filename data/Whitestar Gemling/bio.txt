Adter the exodus of the Carbuncles, an entire era would pass until humans
found a method to replicate the gems on their foreheads. Gemlings feel a
special affinity for Carbuncles and a deep hatred towards humans.

When the Sapphire Carbuncle appeared in the Temple of Lies, Aurum admired
it for a few seconds and decided to create the Whitestar Gemling. Unlike other
Gemlings, the Whitestar has a certain self-awareness and is not guided by just
instinct alone. Its goal is for Carbuncles to reclaim their place in the world, and
its abilities allow it to summon any Carbuncle or Gemling that is less than a
mile away.
