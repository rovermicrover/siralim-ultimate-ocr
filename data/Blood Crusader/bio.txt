Crusaders are warriors of light who have watched over the innocent from time
immemorial. However, their sense of justice is so extreme that they sometimes
end up serving morally dubious causes.

The Blood Crusader's color and abilities made it easy to give it a name. In the
past, it was believed that the blows of its mace only stole the blood of the
wicked. Today it is common knowledge that whether their target is a villain or a
hero matters little.
