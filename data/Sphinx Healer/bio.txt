The people of Kaito venerated the Sphinxes and felt protected in their
presence. They usually made offerings to these creatures in the towns and
cities of the Empire, especially to Sphinx Healers. The sick and those unable to
walk visited the temples where these creatures lived and offered them great
gifts. In return, this creature uttered strange words and the orb it carried with it
emitted a dim light. The diseases disappeared and the injured could walk again.
