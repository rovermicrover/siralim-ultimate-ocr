Adter the defeat of King Sigmund, the survivors of Omnia fled the city, never to
return. Before that, Milner defeated Sigmund's right-hand man, a Mage of great
talent, in single combat. Due to his great power and the magic items he carried,

Ghouls and control their insatiable hunger. The authorities are still trying to find
him to destroy him.
