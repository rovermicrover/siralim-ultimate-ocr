As a result of their mutation, Wolpertingers do not need to sleep. However,
their visual system is not prepared to guide them through the darkness. The
Smiths of the Scarlet Mountains take advantage of this to lay traps during the
night.

Volcanic Wolpertingers usually choose warm places to establish their territory.
Legend has it that the entrance to the Great Pandemonium is actually in the
Frostbite Caverns, which would explain why these creatures can sometimes be
found in such a cold place.
