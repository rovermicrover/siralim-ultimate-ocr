After what happened at Irizen, the Automatons left the town and scattered
throughout Rodia. Today they can be seen anywhere, serving adventurers,
criminal gangs, or just wandering aimlessly.

The War Automaton is the model most commonly produced by the Rodian
government. It consumes less magic than the other Automatons, it is able to
sharpen its sword at any time using its mouth, and it has the flag of the
kingdom for which it fights drawn on its shield.
