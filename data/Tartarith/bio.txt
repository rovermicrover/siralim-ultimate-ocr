When Taylor's father arrived in the city, he was immediately arrested and taken
to the Torture Chamber. His son had fun with him for hours, peeling off his skin,
burning his face, pouring saltwater over him. Tartarith died in great pain and
guilt. Then, the Nether Orbs that Taylor had set as per Vertraag's advice

completely insane. Turned into a merciless God, he approached his son and
said: | WILL NOT BE KILLED. NOW I KILL.
