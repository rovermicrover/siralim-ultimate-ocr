During the new moon phase, the Elves usually climb into the treetops to gaze
at the velvety night sky, speckled with countless stars. There, Elf Mystics sing
ancient songs in a solemn voice about, among other similar things, the rustling
of leaves when they are swayed by the wind. Besides appeasing the soul of
their people, they can channel the energy of the forest into their scepters and
use it to blow up their enemies.
