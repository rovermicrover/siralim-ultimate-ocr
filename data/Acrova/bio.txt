The mountains north of the kingdom of Ercath are infested with these
creatures. The cold and dry climate, the large population of pines and the
scarcity of predators for the Acrova are the biggest reasons. Indeed, these
creatures eat wood, and they don't need much to satisfy their hunger. If they
are in danger, they emit a scream inaudible to the human ear. Immediately, all
the Acrovas in the vicinity gather at that point to face the threat.
