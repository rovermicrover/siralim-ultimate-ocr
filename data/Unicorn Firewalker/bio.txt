Born of primeval magic, the Unicorn Firewalker is literally the worst nightmare
of any Magi who disregard the arcane principles for their own benefit. When it
began to haunt the dreams of one of such Magi, the legendary Helmholtz, he
summoned it in Radia in an attempt to defeat it and escape the nightmares, but
instead it began to physically hunt down all of those who corrupt the ancient art
of magic... starting with him.
