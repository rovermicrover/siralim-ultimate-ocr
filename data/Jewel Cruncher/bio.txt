Siralim's siege of Crux not only caused the Sentinel Watcher to escape, but the
Rod of Ruin was also split into two when the mayor of the city refused to reveal
its purpose to the ruler of Siralim. Unfortunately, that made the Temple of Lies
accessible through other means.

Because the Jewel Cruncher's shell emits a powerful, continuous, golden light
even after death, it has become the target of many warriors since these events
took place. However, Rodia's Council, or what remains of it, is considering the
introduction of a high tax on the sale of products made with this material, as it

would be unfair to the craftsmen who use magic to produce the same effect.
