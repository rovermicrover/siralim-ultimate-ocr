The Carver Shadowstalker is able to channel its magic into the weapons it
wields in order to inflict more damage to its enemies. Sometimes, one of these
fiends will approach a quiet village late at night and slaughter its residents,
house by house. It is believed that this is a kind of ritual that grants it strength
before facing a powerful foe.
