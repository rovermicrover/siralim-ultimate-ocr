The sea is vast and full of hazards, some natural and others not so much.
Shipwrecks are relatively common, and often spell death for the crew members
who manage to stay afloat after the ship has sunk. All is lost for them... unless
it is their lucky day, and a bony hand emerges from the ocean to bring them to
safety. There are many stories and legends about these mysterious creatures
who never utter a word... if they can speak at all. They do not expect anything
in return nor do they communicate in any way with the people they save; they
simply appear when they are needed most, saving victims of shipwrecks or
guiding wandering ships that had lost their way. Some say they come from the
world of the Plague Doctors, others think this is a species who suffered the
same fate as the Shambler Rescuers. When James landed on Rodia, he
brought some of these creatures with him, but his crew never mentioned
seeing them in any of the Revenant engravings.
