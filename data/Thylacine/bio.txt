This extraordinary creature was seen for the first time in the Refuge of the
Magi. Its creator approached it and knelt to admire his success from up close.
The Thylacine playfully put its paws on the Mage's chest, but instead they
pierced him completely. By the time Zonte and Ainsworth reached the
basement, there were no survivors. Only the Thylacine remained. Even for
such skilled Magi, it was difficult to expel this creature from the tower.
