When this creature travels with other members of the Diabolic Horde, it usually
stays apart from the group, studying potential enemies according to the
information provided by the Diabolic Henchman. If it has the opportunity, it will
draw a battle plan before every fight. It uses its two polearms to distract its
enemies and gain a tactical advantage for the squad.
