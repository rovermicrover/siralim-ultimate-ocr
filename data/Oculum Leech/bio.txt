Leeches reportedly feed on the blood of the dead creature that Mortem claimed
as his realm. They have been able to survive in this way for thousands of
years. On the other hand, it seems like the survival instincts of these creatures
have atrophied, or rather, were never really there in the first place.

Although the Oculum Leech is able to see through its eye, it does not
understand what it is seeing, and it is unable to use that information at all.
When it tries to feed, its sight intereferes with its sense of smell, so it often tries
to suck blood from a tree or a wall.
