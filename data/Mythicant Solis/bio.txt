Mythicants do not do much besides training, sleeping, or chasing mice, though
they always defend the victim when they witness an assault.

The mace of the Mythicant Solis does not always have the same shape. When
it attacks an enemy and hits them with its weapon, the round part of it
transforms into words that cause damage. As soon as this creature pulls back
the hilt, the mace instantly returns to its former appearance.
