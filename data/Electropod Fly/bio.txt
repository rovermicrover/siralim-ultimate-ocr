The Electropads are just the first step of an ambitious prcject that aims to
replace organs and limbs with synthetic machinery. These creaturesâ€™ lifeforce
will simply not be depleted unless magic or physical force destroys them.

No other Electropad travels as fast as the Fly Electropod when it takes flight. In
addition, it is capable of changing direction with spectacular speed. However,
hovering at high speeds quickly drains its energy, so it needs to rest right away.
