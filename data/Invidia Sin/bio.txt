When a Sin appears, it does not usually remain in its place of origin for long.
Instead, it wanders through towns and villages looking for people to corrupt.

Sometimes, the Invidia Sin strategically leaves one of its golden mirrors on top
of a barrel or on the sill of a window. If an unwary person touches this item,
both they and their property become the oktject of desire of everyone they cross
paths with.
