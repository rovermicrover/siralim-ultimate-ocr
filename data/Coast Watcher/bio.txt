Watchers appeared in this world for the first time after the humans started to
use magic in their wars.

This creature likes to go unnoticed near statues in temples, waiting for the
moment when someone notices its presence to attack. The Coast Watcher's
spells are more powerful when its opponent has little ability to cast them.
