The angrier a Storm gets, the greater the electrical current that runs through its
body. However, the Storm Lord is always overflowing with electricity regardless
of its emotional state, and it occasionally emits spontaneous discharges that
can kill an animal or a child. On the other hand, the fact that it cannot produce
water like the rest of its species is extremely aggravating to it, so it often insults
the inferior power of the other Stormsâ€™ discharges.
