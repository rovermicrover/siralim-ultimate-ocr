These creatures are vengeful spirits that come from a very distant country.
Aiter being abandoned by their masters during a siege of the temple where
they lived and trained, they swore revenge before dying in that battle. Their
unshakable faith in their beliefs, coupled with the betrayal they felt and the
magic that floated there, made the last wish of these young warriors come true.
Once again on their feet, they dispersed and massacred both those who had
killed them and their own masters, who had abandoned them. However, their
thirst for blood did not go away, and they continue their indiscriminate slaughter
across the continent to this day.
