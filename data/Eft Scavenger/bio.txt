Etts prey on every single creature that inhabits the Blood Grove. Neither the
Inquisitors, who live underground, nor the Satyrs, who build their homes in the
treetops, are safe from these fearsome monsters.

Eft Scavengers are the easiest of their kind to tame. Unlike other Etts, their
instincts do not lead them to hunt, as their main role is to protect the young in
the nest from possible attacks.
