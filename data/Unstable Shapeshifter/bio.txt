Some Shapeshifters have a genetic mutation that prevents them from
maintaining a specific shape for long. They are also unable to fully control what
they transform into and fail many times, becoming a palm tree, for example,
rather than a fir. In addition, when they change shape, the result is always
disastrous and unpleasant to look at. In Shapeshifter societies, these
peculiarities are not considered strange or a defect. However, they know very
well that their transformations scare other species, so they are often in charge
of driving bad-intentioned visitors away.
