Although a Carnage's murderous instinct cannot be suppressed, it can be
tamed to obey its master from a young age. Of course, their masters are
sometimes surprised by a sudden attack from their pet, a surprise that lasts but
a brief moment before they die.

The Rotten Carnage is always shedding its skin, and it needs to eat often to
prevent its entire body from rotting away.
