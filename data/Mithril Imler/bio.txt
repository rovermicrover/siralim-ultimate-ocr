Imlers and Imlings are intelligent creatures who have developed their own
languages. Although they can learn the human language, it is hard for them to
speak it due to their vocal tract.

Mithril Imlers have an extremely hard skin with magical properties that only
affect those of their kind. It also turns them into prey, as many in the upper
echelons of society desire their skin for its beautiful glow. Therefore, they
usually live in the depths of their villages, never exposing themselves.
