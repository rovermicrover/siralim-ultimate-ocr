This creature is not really a Crusader, but an automaton created by the
Auditors to protect Ubi Concordia. When it detects an enemy, the green lights
on its neck blink in a random order. When it is active for a long time, the metal
plates on its back get so hot that you could fry an egg on them. Indeed, if the
creature does not stop to cool down in a timely manner, it will shut down to
prevent damage to its structure.
