Constructs need sunlight in order to move. They have batteries inside them
that gather this energy, but this is not an efficient way of recharging them
during the rainy seasons or in places where the sky is often cloudy. In response
to this, several alternatives have been devised: buying pre-charged batteries,
recharging the batteries with spells, and the Astro Construct. This creature is
constantly receiving energy, not only from the sun, but also from the stars and
the moon, thanks to its much more powerful light receptors. Because this
cutting-edge technology requires the use of one Nether Orb for every one
hundred receptors, its price is simply astronomical.
