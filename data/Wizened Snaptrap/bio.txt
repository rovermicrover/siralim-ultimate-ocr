Like an azure halo under the ceiling of stars, Eferia performs a
phantasmagorical dance of whispers and blurred visions of what hundreds of
creatures lived through until the day a Snaptrap swallowed them whole. The
undisputed protagonists of this dance of life and death are the Wisened
Snaptraps, unforgiving hunters who also feed on other Snaptraps. When the
sun goes down and night falls, they can sometimes block the sky over the
untamed jungle with all the memories that were left inside of them.
