Vulcanar had never intended to help Zonte and the other Magi take back their
tower. However, shortly after emerging from the lava of the Great
Pandemonium, the Dreadful Efreet ordered the Obsidians to open a portal to
the Refuge of the Magi, and they obeyed. The assault was so quick and
effective that the Magi who accompanied them were more concerned with
putting out fires than with attacking. Finally, the Dreadful Efreet forced the Djinn
Ghula to leave the tower with the rest of the Djinns.
