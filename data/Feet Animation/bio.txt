Animations are obedient creatures, though they do not always fully understand
what they are told, and take any order literally.

On more than one occasion, a Feet Animation has begun to move as if it were
dancing for no apparent reason. It was quickly discovered that in all cases,
those feet had once belonged to someone who enjoyed dancing, either
professionally or as a hobby.
