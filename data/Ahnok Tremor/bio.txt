The body of a Tremor is home to numerous creatures, mainly insects. Birds
are commonly seen pecking at a Tremor in search of its guests.

The Ahnok Tremor can effortlessly move earth and rock with its mind. In battle,
it uses this power to create hands and tentacles that cling to the arms and legs
of its enemies and trap them. They often create stone walls in forests and
mountains to protect the animals from poachers.
