The Carver Chopper is more a curse than a creature. It appears in the dreams
of those responsible for the death of many Carvers. At first it will make sporadic
appearances, observing its victim quietly from a distance, as if it were just a
part of the landscape that doesn't quite fit. With time, however, it will begin to
gradually approach its victim until it's close enough and the hunt begins. If it
butchers you with its merciless cleaver inside the dream, you will never wake
up.
