Humans quickly began to use magic in their battles. Although it was
rudimentary, the violence they unleashed knew no limits. It was enough to tear
the fabric of reality. While Gods, humans, and other creatures faced the

gathered around the rifts and looked at the sky. They waited for weeks until the
night turned to day. The Radiant Amaranth descended, wrapped in a power
older than the universe. A power sacrificed to save it.
