Fed up with greed, selfishness and other common human attributes, four Magi
from the Tergath kingdom decided to take matters into their own hands. They
took initiatives to help the underprivileged, using magic to create infrastructures
in order to give jobs and food to as many people as possible. In addition, they
promoted progressive protests, but the Queen who reigned there did not
support their activities. With the army against them, they were finished.
Surrounded by ten of the eleven platoons, they performed a ritual. Their will
would not end that day. Thus, they sacrificed their lives and the Heartminder
was born, a creature who carried their legacy and who would take whatever
actions were necessary to help all who were oppressed by selfishness and
opulence.
