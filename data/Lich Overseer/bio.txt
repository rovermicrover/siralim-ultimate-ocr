Lich Overseers are able to move their scythe-shaped staff with great dexterity
and speed. When they see an ally trying to flee during a raid, there is no
warning â€” just a flash of silver followed by a head rolling on the ground to their
feet. The last thing the deserter will see is an Overseer's boot crushing their
skull.
