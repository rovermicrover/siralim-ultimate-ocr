The Nature Magi, alarmed by the progressive deterioration of the forests,
decided to animate the strongest trees to preserve the ecosystem. They raised
their roots, shook their branches and finally were able to walk on the
deteriorated land that needed their protection.

Ashwood Ents are rarely aggressive, and often walk through the forest looking
for injured animals to help them.
