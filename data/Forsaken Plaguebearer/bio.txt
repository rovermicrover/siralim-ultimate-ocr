During the siege of Omnia, several magic students were assigned to protect
the University. Shortly before the Unification forces achieved victory, the
Festering Ghoul entered the University followed by a hundred Ghouls. The
students soon realized there was nothing they could do. One locked herself in
the biological experimentation room, but the doors gave way and she was
killed. Her left arm is now a factory of diseases, although until now she had
remained in Omnia and her existence was unknown.
