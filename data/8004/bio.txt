B004 is the only creature R080 has created. Its initial purpose was to help him
gather information about the world, but now that he has dealt with some
mortals, the God of Science is making a great effort to implement a
mechanism that allows B004 to understand the emotions of living beings at a
higher speed. His success is, at the moment, very questionable, since B004
tends to assume that everyone feels an uncontrollable emotional maelstrom all
the time and does not stop constantly asking the people it meets if they are
feeling okay.
