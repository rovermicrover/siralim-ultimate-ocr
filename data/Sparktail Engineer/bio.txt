Sparktails are generally peaceful creatures, and when they reach maturity they
gain the ability to levitate by using powerful electromagnetism.

The smartest Sparktails can become anything they want, such as scientists,
engineers, or judges, but they are all commonly called Sparktail Engineers.
They can use the electricity in their tails in a very verstaile way which, for
example, allows them to weld metals, provoke chemical reactions or even
create an electric current to resuscitate an individual in cardiac arrest. These
creatures are very rare in Rodia. Most of them live in the countries in the north
of the continent, where magic is harder to develop and technology is much
more advanced, in part thanks to their contributions.
