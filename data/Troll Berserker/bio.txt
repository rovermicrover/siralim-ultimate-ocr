Many Trolls live in the mountains and lead a relatively quiet life, though they
are not as common as the warrior tribes that come down the mountain some
nights to do what they do best: make trouble.

Troll Berserkers are warriors of these tribes able to enter a sort of trance that
makes them unstoppable even when the battle is over, as they will sometimes
attack their allies when there are no enemies left to annihilate.
