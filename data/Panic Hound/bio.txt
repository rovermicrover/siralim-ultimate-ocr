Hounds are extremely agile, and their bite can pierce even iron. Moreover, they
are good strategists who divide their roles and know to turn tail and run when
they are at a disadvantage.

The Panic Hound fights differently from its packmates, running from side to
side without attacking directly. Then, swift as an arrow, it uses its tail to tear at
its enemiesâ€™ legs so that they lose balance, giving them a huge disadvantage
during battle.
