The various ecosystems of Hutika are home to creatures like the Luckmantrias,
found nowhere else in the world. However, nature always finds a way â€” or a
Uralos who wanted to make some easy money loses sight of a box full of eggs
for a few seconds in one of the worst neighborhoods of Neralim.

Ace Luckmantrias can perfectly camouflage themselves in the fall, which is
why they sleep for a quarter of the year without needing to feed, so they can be
awake at all times during the other seasons.
