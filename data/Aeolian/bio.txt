The God of Wind is the most devoted protector of nature. Like many other
Gods, he can see what is happening anywhere without being physically
present, but Aeolian enjoys traveling and rarely stays in the same place for
long. He often flies over the Unsullied Meadows, sometimes in the company of
Dragons, with one eye always on the grass and trees that extend into his realm
as far as the eye can see.
