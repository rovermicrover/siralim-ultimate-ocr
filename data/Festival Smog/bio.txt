The Festival Smog is a creature originally designed for festive purposes. It was
developed in an illegal laboratory and it usually fetches a high price in the black
market. The Mage who directed the prcject was expelled from the Magic
University of Siralim years ago for performing illegal tests on intelligent
sukjects, and she was locked in a regular prison with anti-magic protection.
However, she managed to escape thanks to her contacts and started a new
life. The authorities are currently trying to track down her fraudulent activities
without much success.
