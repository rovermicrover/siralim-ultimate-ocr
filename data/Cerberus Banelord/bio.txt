The Cerberus Banelord gives off an aura that instills fear and sadness in any
weak-willed people near it. It is also one of the few intelligent Cerberuses, and it
has other creatures such as Carvers or Fiends under its command. It leads
them with an iron paw and makes them work in the mines of the Great
Pandemonium. After a workday, it usually sits in its den and reads some books
from the surface, accompanied by a servant whose job is to turn the pages.
