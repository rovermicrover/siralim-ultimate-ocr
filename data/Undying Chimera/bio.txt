Chimeras do need to sleep, and they have the ability to do so for long periods
of time, which allows them to stay awake for many, many days.

Undying Chimeras are quite reserved and do not usually participate in
conversations, but when they do it is always in a yelling voice, as they are
simply incapable of speaking in a lower volume. Fortunately for them, this does
not bother other Chimeras, and it is also not why these creatures are so quiet.
