Two hundred years ago, the dean of the Magic University of Neralim received a
gift from one of her colleagues for Purple Victory Day. When she opened it, she
was greeted by two dreadful rows of fangs and devoured in a single bite before
she could react. The next morning her colleague was provisionally appointed
as dean; a position she managed to keep for ten years, which at the time was
the longest possible term of deanship, established to prevent such practices.
