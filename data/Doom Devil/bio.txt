When it finds a person in a tavern that looks sad and lonely, it will approach
them and offer a deal. Once they shake its right hand, their fate is sealed. The
Doom Devil usually returns favors in its own way, killing someone if possible.
Once they fulfill their part of the deal, the Devil takes advantage of wording of
the deal to, at best, leave them without a single coin. If they do not fulfill their
part, their heart simply stops beating.
