Instead of falling into the supposed trap and sending the ships against the
Valkyries, Sigmund sent his army of Pit Worms against them. Helmholtz, who
already knew that many of these creatures were at his service, cast a spell that
made the ground harder so that the Pit Worms could not emerge from under
them as easily.

The more time a Pit Worm Gladiator spends in front of food (that is, any
creature), the greater its desire to devour it, and the more dangerous its bites
become.
