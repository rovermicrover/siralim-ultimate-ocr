Griffons protect the Azure Dream, and there is always a legion of them flying
over the clouds in search of intruders. During mating season, their flocks gather
in the air and can even block out the sun across a wide area.

Although their ability to wield weapons cannot be compared to that of a human,
Assault Griffons can inflict great damage by charging at their enemies with
great speed, passing them by without exposing themselves to a counterattack.
