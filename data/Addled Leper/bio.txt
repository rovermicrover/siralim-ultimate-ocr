There is a rare disease in Rodia that only affects humans. It was first
discovered in Taylor's time. In its early stages, the disease manifests as painful
sores on the skin of the limbs.

The Addled Leper can sometimes be seen standing still, with its eyes fixed on
something. It could be a book, a meadow, or the full moon. For a few
moments, these sights bring back memories to its mind, and they remember
who they were.
