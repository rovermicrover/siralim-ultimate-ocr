Since the beginning of time, the Goddess of Poison, also known as the Spider
Queen, has maintained a certain rivalry with Vertraag that no mortal would
describe as friendly. On one occasion, Regalis presented the Gad of Time with
a huge statue of himself, but the inside was hollow and contained millions of
spider eggs. When someone is caught in the webs of the Arachnid Nest,
Regalis considers them her property, and she keeps certain individuals she
likes as her slaves.
