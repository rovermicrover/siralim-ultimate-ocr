Satyrs originally came from the kingdom of Vanelin, fruit of the union of the
barbarian tribes and the great northern cities of what would later be known as
Rodia. Because of this, their worship of the Gods is somewhat contradictory,
given that they routinely worship Gonfurian as well as Aeolian and Surathli, two
deities who do not share the God of War's taste for blood. However, some
Satyrs such as Rammers and the Unleashed prefer the teachings of Gonfurian.

Satyr Squires guard the backs of their most fearless Satyr allies, especially the
Unleashed. Furthermore, they frequently patrol the suspension bridges and
wooden walkways that link their treetop homes to ensure no Efts have climbed
up to unleash chaos.
