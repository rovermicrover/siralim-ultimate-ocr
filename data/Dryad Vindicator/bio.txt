Faced with an increase in harmful human activities, the famous Nature Mage
Calkins had an idea for the Dryads to overcome their limitations. With the help
of other Nature Magi, she enchanted a sprout of each oak and gave it to the
Dryads.

The Dryad Vindicator uses her wooden sword to punish any creature she finds
cutting trees or damaging bushes. The wounds she inflicts cause her victims to
undergo a slow but inexorable transformation into the plant they were harming.
