To the followers of Surathli in particular, the Cherub holds special holy
significance. Their strong resemblence to unborn children early in development
leads many to believe that the Cherubs will, over time, gradually transform into
something far greater and more powerful. If there is any truth to this theory, the
fact that the Cherubs have changed little since their discovery suggests a
tremendously long transformation indeed.

Preta Cherubs are one of the more dangerous kinds of Cherub and by far the
most hostile to living creatures. One touch from its body can badly disrupt all
kinds of energies magical and mundane alike, leaving its prey in agony and
often well beyond saving. For such victims, the only ministration their comrades
can offer is a quick end to their suffering.
