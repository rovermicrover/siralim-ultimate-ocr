It was first seen in Undolim, on top of the temple of Surathli. It was described
as an elusive specter that disappeared when its presence was perceived by too
many. During the night of the winter solstice, a child discovered a large number
of these creatures walking on the roofs. Luckily, her mother verified that it was
true and immediately notified the authorities, preventing the Roofstalker Wights
from massacring the faithful who were preparing to celebrate the festivities in
the temple.
