Imps are noisy, unruly creatures, more dangerous to themselves than to the
rest of the world. However, ambitious individuals abandon their villages to seek
their fortune outside their lands.

Imp Hexers have a natural talent for teaching magic to other creatures. Indeed,
they sometimes train Imp children from nearby families, who often end up
burning their own cabins when their parents are distracted.
