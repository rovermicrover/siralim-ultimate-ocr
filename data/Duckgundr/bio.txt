The Auditors recently constructed a snake-shaped device that can penetrate
the rifts that led the Watchers to this world thousands of years ago. They
wanted find out what lies on the other side, and hopefully find a way to close
them once and for all. For the first time in history, something went through the
rifts in the opposite direction. However, what came back was organic, had a
beak, and had duct tape on its tail. A tape that obviously was not enough to
close the rifts. Dragan looked at the creature with a raised eyebrow and said
‘Whatever is on the other side is laughing at us’, although what really happened
was somewhat different—the intentions of whatever was on the other side
translated into sarcasm when Duckgundr returned to our world, transforming it
as a result.
