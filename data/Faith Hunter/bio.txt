Hunters are nomadic creatures that travel around the world on the backs of
great wolves. The bond between the rider and its mount is established from a
young age, and they generally do not separate until one of them dies. All of
them follow the ideals of Meraxis, which are not too clear to most humans and
other intelligent species, and the God of Bliss grants them special powers in
exchange, like the Faith Hunter's ability to bring its allies back to life.
