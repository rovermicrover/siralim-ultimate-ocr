Spielrein and Baker shared the same principles, and together they started the
Sanctus prcject. Its purpose was to create a creature that could punish Sins

the items that the Sins carry in their hands.

The Humanitas Sanctus forces arrogant people to spend the rest of their lives
serving their neighbor whenever they can, even if it endangers their own lives.
