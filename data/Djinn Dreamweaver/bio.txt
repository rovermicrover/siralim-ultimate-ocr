The Magi of the Refuge wanted to create a creature that could grant simple
wishes to aid them with mundane tasks and in their investigations.

Some Djinn Dreamweavers hide in their lamp near trade routes until an
unsuspecting merchant confuses it with a valuable object due to its golden
color. At night, the creature comes out and modifies its target's dreams day
after day, introducing ideas and desires until it turns the victim into a slave.
