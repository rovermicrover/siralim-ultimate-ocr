Because of their inexpressiveness, it may seem like Grenales do not
understand what the people around them are saying; but in truth they are great
listeners. They especially enjoy stories of battles and adventures, but when a
Grenale hears something particularly unpleasant, it often gets upset and
explodes, coating everyone around it in beer. Owners of these creatures
usually apologize claiming that Grenales cannot control their explosions, but
this is absolutely not true.
