went their separate ways. She is considered the greatest philosopher and

The Devil Voidlord is believed to have taken the form and behaviour of a
sadistic, bloodthirsty creature that went extinct thousands of years ago. Its

sever the limbs of their victims, leaving them completely and utterly mutilated.
