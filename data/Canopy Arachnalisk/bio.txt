The Canopy Arachnalisk is the most aggressive of its species, and it even tries
to ambush prey bigger than itself. Its web is not intricate and usually consists of
a single thread that goes around several trees on ground level and low
branches. This creature restlessly waits at the top waiting for a pull, at which
time it will fall on whatever touched the thread without stopping to assess its
chances.
