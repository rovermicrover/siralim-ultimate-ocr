When King Misery began searching for Smiths throughout the kingdoms, some
of his slaves decided to help him by revealing where their acquaintances were
in exchange for freedom. From that moment they became a nomadic group of
renegades who reject cities, wars, kingdoms and their laws. At present, those
traitors are already dead, but their descendants have preserved their nomadic
tradition, as well as their resentment towards society.
