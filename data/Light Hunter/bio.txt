It has recently been discovered that Hunters possess a complex language
comparable to that of humans and other creatures, spoken through
high-pitched vocalizations reminiscent of a cat's meow.

When a Faith Hunter gains enough favor with Meraxis, its body lights up and
the Ankh it uses as a weapon becomes a saber of light. Although it can still die
from wounds or disease, it gains eternal youth.
