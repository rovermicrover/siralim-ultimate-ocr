The Stone Devil usually roams around the periphery of the woods, looking for
innocent campers who just want to relax in nature. It will appear to be a
good-natured satyr and tell anyone it finds that it knows of a beautiful place
near the forest entrance where they could go spend the afternoon. Once it
guides them there, it will wait until they make a "mistake". A broken branch, a
flower stepped on by accident. Any excuse will do to bludgeon them to death
with its heavy mace.
