The Chaos Troll is always on the front lines, and before entering battle it
consumes a drug that inhibits pain and causes an uncontrollable state of anger.
Its body paint is not merely decorative, it is also used to warn other Trolls of its
presence, as it is likely to attack them as well after all enemies are gone.
