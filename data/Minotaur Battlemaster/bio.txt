Minotaur Battlemasters are in charge of training young Minotaurs in the art of
war. They are usually the oldest, whose fighting ability has been greatly
diminished by age, though younger Minotaurs with a gift for teaching can also
become Battlemasters. These creatures can wield almost any weapon and are
skilled battle strategists, which makes them perfectly suited for their job.
