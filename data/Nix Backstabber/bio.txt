There was once a Nix who envied mankind. Their civilization prospered, while
Nixes still lived in small settlements that did not. This rage led her to Gonfurian,
and she asked him to eliminate the humans. The God of War laughed out loud,
but he offered her a solution in exchange for passing a trial. The Nix accepted
and had her own village fight a human town. They lost. Then, Gonfurian
appeared before her and gave his favor to a mortal for the first time in history...
plus another "small" gift.
