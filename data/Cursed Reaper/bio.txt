Just like Banshees, Reapers can be seen when a life is about to end, or when a
catastrophe is about to occur. However, these creatures are silent and only
move when death comes. As they have eternal life, these beings have been
the target of numerous spells over the years. After being hit with a certain
number of curses, their structure changes and they become Cursed Reapers,
entities that bring bad luck to anyone who approaches them.
