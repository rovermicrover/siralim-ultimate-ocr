These creatures simply cannot sit still for more than a minute. If there is food to
spare and no neighboring tribes lett, they gather around a fire, jumping and
laughing without rest, often pushing each other into the flames.

Although all Maniacs go to war, Maniac Warriors are the fiercest of their kind,
and often end up becoming Leaders. They are also the most restless of their

kind, and need to fight all the time. It is not strange for a Warrior to wound or

even kill a member of its own tribe just for fun.
