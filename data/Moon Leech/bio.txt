Of the five newest Gods, Mortem was the only one who did not create a realm
to stop the advance of the Itherian Realms. Instead, he created a powerful seal
inside the body of a creature the size of a star.

This dangerous creature flies high in search of prey, then drops on them.
Fortunately, its sense of smell is not entirely accurate, so it ends up hitting the
ground an alarming number of times. When this happens, the only thing left of
the creature is a slimy, lifeless mass.
