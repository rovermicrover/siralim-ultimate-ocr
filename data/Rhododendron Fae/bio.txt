The Fae Lands is a lush forest where day and night cycles are ten times longer.
When it gets dark, the mushrooms that sprout on many of its trees emit a
fluorescent light in many colors.

The Rhododendron Fae's flapping makes no sound. In addition, they are
capable of altering both the intensity and the color of their trails, naturally pink,
and are even able to make them invisible. Even at night, a Fae's trail is not
visible at great distances, especially in the thicket, but this ability makes
Rhododendron Fae virtually undetectable and the best creatures for a surprise
attack.
