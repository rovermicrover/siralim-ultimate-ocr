This fiendish creature specializes in making a racket before the Diabolic
Horde's incursions, distracting their foes before they have a chance to regroup.
If the enemy has a bonfire, it whips it, creating a cloud of ash and smoke to
signify the start of the battle. It is also in charge of taming the beasts on which
the Diabolic Horde rides, making sure that, despite their violent nature, they
only bite their opponents.
