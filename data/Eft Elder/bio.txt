Ets are terrifying carnivourous beasts. They have an excellent sense of smell,
and their eyes allow them to detect living beings at great distances. They can
also perceive heat in the dark.

Etts usually live short lives, as Satyrs and Inquisitors exterminate them
whenever they find their nests, and Efts sometimes cannibalize each other for
food. However, some Efts survive long enough to become Elders. Efts have a
somewhat confusing hierarchy, as the place each individual occupies is never
clear, but herds that have an Elder always survive for much longer.
