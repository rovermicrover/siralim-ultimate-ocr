Pit Wraiths fold and unfold spontaneously in different eras of history. On one
occasion, Baker lost her Pit Wraith in the middle of a fight against an Ira Sin.
When she tried to flee from the Magnificus Sanctus, it mysteriously reappeared
and gave its life so that she could escape.

A Pit Wraith Obliterator is a binary existence: one version exists an instant after
the other. It seems to leave an afterimage when it moves, but the weaker it
becomes, the less powerful its later version becomes.
