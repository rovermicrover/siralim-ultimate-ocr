When a Lightning Cerberus gets angry, the electricity that runs through its body
reaches 200 volts, so it can throw anyone who touches it into the air. This
creature does not need to bite; it channels its electrical energy into a sphere
capable of burning any creature it touches to a crisp. It is especially dangerous
on rainy days, because just touching the water on the ground where it is
standing can lead to electrocution.
