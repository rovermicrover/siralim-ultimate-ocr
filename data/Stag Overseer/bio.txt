The Stag Overseer is a monster of the night that terrorizes unfortunate
travelers. This creature likes to stand tall in the distance, forming a dark
silhouette against the full moon. When someone notices it, it disappears into
the shadows, moving silently while hiding from its victims. Until, suddenly, they
are lost in the dark, never to be seen again.
