Sins are the counterpart of Sanctuses, as well as their quintessential nemeses.
When two of them meet they completely lose control, and a catastrophic battle
ensues that devastates their surroundings due to their great power.

The Gula Sin likes to sneak into lavish banquets and leave one of its pieces of
meat on a tray. If someone bites it, that person will not be able to stop eating,
even if sated, until all the nearby food is gone.
