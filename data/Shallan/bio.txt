Unlike the Fae, Shallan is quiet and calm. She spends most of her time lying
down or flying slowly while watching over her realm, although she does
occasionally approach other creatures to play with them, tell stories, or simply
strike up conversation. Now that the Auditors have found a way into the realm,
she is not at all happy due to the influx of looters. She has ordered all Fae to
attack any intruder, especially those who try to cut down trees or take the
creatures that inhabit the Fae Lands.
