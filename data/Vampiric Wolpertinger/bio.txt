Wolpertingers are dangerous beasts that live mainly in high mountain areas.
Creatures like Trolls or the Smiths of the Scarlet Mountains often have trouble
with them.

Due to their unstable structure, some Wolpertingers mutate into the Vampiric
subspecies without any specific cause. This creature's visual system does not
allow it to receive clear images during the day. However, it is an insatiable
predator at night, feeding on the blood of other creatures until they are
completely dry.
