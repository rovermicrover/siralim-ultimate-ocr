Crystal Smiths, together with Brim Smiths and Hammer Lords, are the only
ones of their kind that have managed to successfully integrate in the towns and
villages of Rodia. Indeed, in kingdoms such as Vanelin or Undolim, where the
cult of Yseras is widespread, they were received with joy and admiration thanks
to their appearance. However, some of them live in the Gorgon colonies, where
they help their people thrive with their forging skills.
