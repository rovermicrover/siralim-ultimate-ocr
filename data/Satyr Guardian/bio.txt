Satyrs soon began trading with the other intelligent species of the Blood Grove
â€” the Inquisitors. They traded fruit, cattle, tools, and knowledge for silk,
different cattle and a variety of metals and minerals.

To safeguard the well-being of their people, some Satyrs protect the most
vulnerable areas from attack, but Satyr Guardians are never alone. Whether
they like it or not, the nature of the Unleashed Satyrs has made collaboration
between the two a necessity.
