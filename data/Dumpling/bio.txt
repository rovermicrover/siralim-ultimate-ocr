Dumplings are extremely rare and peaceful creatures whose existence was
doubted for a very long time. Great power can be obtained by eating them, and
some believe that consuming their flesh can even grant extraordinary abilities
such as immortality or telekinesis. They are very sociable and enjoy the
company of other creatures, but their delicious appearance and the legends
surrounding them often turn them into prey... if one can catch them before they
flee.
