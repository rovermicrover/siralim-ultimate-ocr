Grimoires love being read and enjoy being transported along with other books.
When they find an individual that is willing to read their pages, these creatures
usually stay by their side forever, unless abandoned.

When Apollinaire left the Columbia Tower, the Hidden Grimoire and the rest of
them who decided to stay took the ripped pages from the Necro Grimoire and
used them to give life to the Runic Grimoire.
