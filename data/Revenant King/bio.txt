Most Revenants live in small tribes that are in constant war with each other.
When these groups contain more than one hundred creatures, several of them
proclaim themselves Kings. Naturally, the result is a battle to the death in which
only the survivor goes on to govern the other Revenants. If it manages to
consolidate its position as a leader, a Revenant King will never lose the respect
of its people, who will obey its orders without questioning them and even give
their lives to protect it.
