Due to the constant persecution to which Harpies have been subjected for
thousands of years, they have become especially ingenious when it comes to
choosing a place to build their nests. Stony islets, high mountain peaks, or old
Arachnalisk nests are usually safe options.

The Queen, who is usually the oldest Harpy, is obeyed and fed by the others.
Although its only duty is to decide the next place in which to sow chaos, its
perverse instincts prevent it from staying in the nest without helping.
