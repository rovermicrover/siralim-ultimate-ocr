These creatures can only be found in the wild in the kingdom of Ahruna. Their
multicolored shells attract many insects they feed on, so they never need to go
in search of prey. In addition, these creatures are capable of changing color at
will, so it is very easy for them to hide if someone tries to capture them. Over
time, they have learned to make their colors fade if they are caught, so they are
no longer attractive to those who would catch them to keep as pets.
