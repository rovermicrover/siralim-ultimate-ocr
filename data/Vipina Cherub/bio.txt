Each Cherub is always wreathed in a magical aura, which have a great deal of
diversity. From blazing and burning auras to glimmering clouds of freezing cold
air, brilliant lights and impenetrable darknesses, all manner of Cherubs have
been seen and recorded throughout the ages. What they are often found to
lack however is drive or will, as most seem simply content to float about the
realms taking few wilful actions.

The flora strewn about the Vipina Cherub's body is not actually a part of it, but
are regular plants that have somehow adapted to feed on the Cherub's stored
energy. While this is a parasitism, it does not seem to cause any particular
harm to the Cherub. The blooms are potent magical reagents, but obtaining
one is difficult as the Cherub seems unwilling to allow anyone to take them.
