A Paragon's weak point is its face, as the rest of its body is made of diamond
and extremely difficult to pierce. The pieces of diamond that fall from them
transform into sand when they hit the ground.

The Topaz Paragon is a restless, adventurous creature. It is curious about the
world, its history and its traditions, and never stays in the same place for long. It
is also against the indiscriminate use of magic, and one of them leads an
important movement in Ahruna to restrict its use.
