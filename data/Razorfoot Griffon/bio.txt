As their average lifespan exceeds 150 years, Griffons are usually involved in
hundreds of battles throughout their lives. In the final stage of their life cycle,
the claws of many Griffons are heavily deteriorated because of these battles.
Some of these Griffons add sharp blades to their claws, obtained from
defeated enemies, so that they can keep being active members of their flock.
