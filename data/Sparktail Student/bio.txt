Sparktails are an intelligent species that reaches maturity once a third of their
life cycle has passed. This moment is called the Step, an event that literally
changes them for the rest of their lives. Depending on their personality and
what they have learned, their entire structure changes to grant them various
abilities. Before the Step, their electricity is still weak and invisible, and does not
allow them to do anything special, so they are required to live at Blue Emerald
for their safety and learning.
