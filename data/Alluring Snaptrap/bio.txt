Years before weighing anchor at Rodia, the legendary pirate Willian James and
his crew managed to find an island of which only a few rumors existed. Eferia,
the indomitable jungle, inhabited by a single intelligent species, the Ak'haruts,
to which one of the Auditors’ agents, known as The Lost, belongs.

The substance released by the Alluring Snaptrap is extremely dangerous, as
the brain interprets its smell as that of something familiar, such as food or the
trace of a relative. Initially, it reproduced the scent of its victims’ favorite food,
but the adaptability arms race between predator and prey has brought them to
a point where Eferia's fauna follows the trail of any pleasant smell with much
caution, and Alluring Snaptraps hide among vegetation.
