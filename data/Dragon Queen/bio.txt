Dragons were the work of Aeolian, long before humans built their cities and
established their kingdoms. They dedicate a great part of their lives to
gathering piles of gold and jewels that they use as a bed.

Not all Dragons live in groups, but those who do are always governed by a
Dragon Queen. In critical situations, the Queen is able to assess the situation
in a matter of seconds and figure out the enemy's strategy to turn it against
them.
