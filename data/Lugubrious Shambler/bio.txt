This is the corpse of a majestic creature who flew in the skies near that island
where William James and his people found the curse that still haunts them
today. In its original form, the Lugubrious Shambler does not age, and lays a
single egg every one thousand years. It is a docile creature, but it becomes a
formidable adversary if attacked. James's crew lost over fifty of his men trying
to hunt one down due to a "mistake" of one of his boatswains. After making
him walk the plank as punishment, James took the undead corpse of this
creature with him to Rodia. During the journey, he discovered that its ability to
lay eggs not only had not disappeared, but had been substantially enhanced,
although its progeny was not exactly alive. The Lugubrious Shambler is not as
powerful as it was in life, which is a good thing, since it was able to cast
devastating spells with every tick of the clock.
