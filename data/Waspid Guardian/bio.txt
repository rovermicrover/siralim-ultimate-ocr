Few creatures have earned as much disdain from the people of Rodia as the
Waspids. Their sting produces pain and fever, but it is not always deadly.

Whenever there is a confrontation between two hives, the Waspid Guardians
form a circle around their queen. Their mission is to protect it at all costs from
the enemy Infiltrators, as all life in the hive would end without it, and its
offspring would become wandering Waspids.
