The Unification War had begun. That which Surathli feared most was unfolding
before her eyes, inexorably, endangering all her hopes.

Seraphs are incredibly long-lived, but they cannot reproduce without the
blessing of Surathli. When she gives it, a new Seraph is immediately conceived
as a sphere of light that grows and takes shape for twenty-three months.

The Undolim Seraph is the most merciful of its siblings and always cares for
them. It detests violence and, if possible, it will not spill a single drop of blood.
Protecting the innocent is what matters most to it, so it will not hesitate to join a
battle if Rodia's peace is in danger.
