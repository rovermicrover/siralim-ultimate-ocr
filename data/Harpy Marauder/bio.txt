Harpies always need to be cautious when they attack a settlement. In general,
they only approach civilization when they want to sow chaos, since everyone
tries to kill them. Even so, few Harpies manage to survive for long.

The Harpy Marauder is a very cunning Harpy Hag that has managed to survive
longer than any other. It is considered a calamity by the government of Rodia,
as its incursions are rarely thwarted. Naturally, the reward for its head is a small
fortune.
