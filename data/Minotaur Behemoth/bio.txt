Most Minotaurs are native to the Kingdom of Heretics, and their settlements
are spread throughout Rodia, which has proved to be a headache for all of the
country's rulers due to their warlike nature, so they are watched closely.

The Behemoth is the commander of the great armies of Minotaurs and does
not falter when facing creatures larger than itself. Before entering battle, it
bangs its armor with its greataxe to signal to those who accompany it that the
battle may begin.
