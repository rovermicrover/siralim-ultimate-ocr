The new realms also served as a way to seal dangerous creatures that
threatened the safety of the world, like the Voidlords, who could erase any
creature from existence.

With enough concentration, Hemomancers can draw a creature's blood
through a wound and move it through the air, or drive their own blood into an
organism. If a Mutant Hemomancer introduces enough of its blood into another
creature's circulatory system and it is not removed in time, an irreversible
transformation takes place that turns the creature into a mindless Hemomancer
who only obeys the orders of a Hemomancer Lord.
