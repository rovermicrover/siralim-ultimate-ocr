Phase Warriors are remnants of people who once fought in important battles. A
powerful enchantment is needed to create them, and it can only be cast by a
competent Mage in exchange for their own life.

Every living being can produce a remnant. The Phase Champion has the
power to channel that possibility and use it to return the soul of a dead creature
to its body.
