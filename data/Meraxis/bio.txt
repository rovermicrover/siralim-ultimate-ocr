Meraxis's realm is an inhospitable place full of secrets that only the bravest
adventurers dare to enter. However, the God of Bliss is peaceful and
good-natured, and has a good relationship with the other Gods. Or, at least, as
good as it can be with the likes of Torun and Tartarith. His innocence and
carelessness have led him to remain on the sidelines during most of the
conflicts that have endangered the world. However, he decided to take sides
with the other Gods against the threat of an old ruler of Siralim.
