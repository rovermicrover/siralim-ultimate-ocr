When an Icemane Yeti leaves the Frostbite Caverns, it leaves a characteristic
trail of frost behind it that warns travelers of its presence. It is not excessively
dangerous by itself, but it is better to avoid them when they travel with other
kinds of Yetis, since its mere presence prolongs the effects of freezing,
considerably reducing the chances of survival of anyone who faces them.
