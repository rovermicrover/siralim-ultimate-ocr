This creature appears with a snap, curving space around it. The Stag Abstract
does not walk, it is simply in one place and then instantly in another. Its attacks
are devastating, as predicting its movements is virtually impossible. There is a
rumor that this creature's antlers allow travel between worlds, but it is more
likely that whoever confronts it will only get a one-way ticket to the afterlife.
