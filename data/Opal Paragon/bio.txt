Before fighting Sigmund, Helmholtz and Milner started an experiment with their
Topaz and Diamond Paragons, using cutting-edge techniques of magical
engineering, as well as an opal and an amethyst. The result was two unique
Paragons designed specifically to help them defeat the (until recently) most
powerful dark lord of all time. When the Unification War ended, the Opal
Paragon asked Milner for its freedom and she accepted. Since then it has
worked as an advisor to the royal family in Neralim.
