These creatures are not really made of gingerbread. If so, any blow could
cause them to crumble and it would be impossible for them to enter battle.
They are intelligent and inhabit a forest southeast of Undolim. They are
excellent bakers, and there are actually several cooking schools throughout
Rodia where these creatures teach. Gingerbread cookies in the shape of men,
typical in Rodia, were first baked when a student made some for his
Singerbread Man teacher, baking them in its own appearance.
