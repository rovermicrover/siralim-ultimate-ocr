Pilwiz that never farm are a rare, but necessary exception for the perfection of
the art of cultivation. The Pilwiz Herbalist's knowledge ranges from the genetic
engineering of plants through breeding to the study of their medicinal
properties. When a Pilwiz becomes seriously ill or unable to move, a bird is
sent to the nearest Herbalist's cabin to request its services.
