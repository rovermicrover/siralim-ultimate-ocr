Reclusive Wights are an exception among their kind, who do not seek revenge
for lost wars, but redemption. They travel the plains day and night, and though
their appearance does not make it easy for them to make friends, some have
managed to settle in some villages thanks to their good deeds. However,
although many of them prefer to earn an honest living taking care of livestock
or helping with the harvest, some still retain their warrior spirit and would not
refuse having a great adventure.
