A year had passed since the Shadows became that boy's whole life, and he
had completely mastered them. With them, he scared his neighbors and
schoolmates, and occasionally made the Shadows hit them when they made
him angry.

Shadow Moths have started to worry the local authorities. Although their
behaviour is mastly the same as that of normal moths, their large size frightens
the locals, who often anger these creatures when trying to scare them away,
causing them to attack. It has recently been found that luckily, the creatures
who can create other Shadows can only do so once a day.
