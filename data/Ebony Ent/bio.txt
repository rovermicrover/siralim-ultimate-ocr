Ents are incredibly long-lived creatures, but their roots often break due to their
long trips, forcing them to remain immobile for a long time to regenerate.

Many birds like to nest in the trunk and branches of the Ebony Ent, sa it is
common to see these creatures accompanied by small sparrows, blackbirds or
even magpies.
