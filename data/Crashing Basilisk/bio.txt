There are numerous myths about Basilisks. They are said to cause death with
a single glance, to have control over snakes, and even to be born from a
chicken egg hatched by a toad. Although none of those things are true, their
real powers make them dangerous creatures.

The Crashing Basilisk can use its voice to randomly activate any magic items
around it. With enough practice, it can hone its ability to avoid any detrimental
effects.
