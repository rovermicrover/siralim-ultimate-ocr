In Nix societies, females occupy higher places in the hierarchy. They hold the
moral authority and leadership, and always govern through a council of eight
women.

The Nix Guardian usually works as a personal bodyguard for great merchants
or crime bosses, and also does the dirty work when it is necessary. When two
Nixes meet because of this, they fight to the death on an equal focting, with
their faces uncovered.
