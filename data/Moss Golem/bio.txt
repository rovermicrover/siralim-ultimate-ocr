Although a Moss Golem will never disobey an order from the Mage to whom it
belongs, it prefers to live in the depths of a forest, where it can stay completely
still and blend with its environment. If it hears the sound of woad yielding to the
steel of an axe, it will open its eyes and start moving with the sole purpose of
destroying the one who dared damage its home.
