Demigods are eccentric and whimsical, do not usually have much patience and
do not tolerate insolent behavior. The Celestial Idol likes to be constantly
worshipped, but it cannot stand the bustle of the city. It usually settles down in a
small town or a village and forces people to build a statue to which they must
pray daily, usually under the threat of raining fire from the sky if anyone does
not comply with its demands.
