Every town hall in Rodia offers a reward for the corpse of a Harpy, so they risk
getting killed if they approach a town.

The flight of the Harpy Hag is erratic and very difficult to predict, thanks to its
experience. When an opponent tries to adopt a defensive position, this creature
charges from any direction and performs a feint at the last moment, which
usually interrupts the enemy's action.
