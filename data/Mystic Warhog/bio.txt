Warhogs are meek creatures who avoid humans, orcs, and other intelligent
beings at all costs.

The Mystic Warhog's supernatural powers are well known to the inhabitants of
Rodia, and it is said a Nature Mage granted these powers to them in ancient
times. When one of these Warhogs senses the presence of a being who
wishes it harm, it rears up and screams wildly.
