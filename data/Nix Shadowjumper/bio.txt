Nixes who work as hired killers wear a mask to prevent anyone from
recognizing them, but also to indicate their specialty. In their daily life, surface
Nixes are treated with a certain forced respect for fear of their abilities.

Nix Shadowjumpers are especially dangerous, and their services are the most
expensive ones to hire. Through their knowledge of magic, they can use the
Path of the Damned to appear behind their target, as long as they have one of
their personal items.
