Nine Tailed Harvesters inhabit the Hamubo Rocky Mountains, to the southeast
of Yarthe. Since the dawn of their civilization they have worshipped death, and
to them Harvesters are sacred creatures who should not be disturbed under
any circumstances. Their lives revolve around their customs and rites, centered
on meditation, and they do not seek war with other peoples. However, they also
need to defend themselves. All Nine Tailed Harvesters receive combat training
from a young age, and all of them use a scythe in battle.
