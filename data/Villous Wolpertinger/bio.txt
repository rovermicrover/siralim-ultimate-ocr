This creature's sight is stunted, but it can orient itself perfectly using its other
senses. For this reason, the Villous Wolpertinger is the only one of its kind who
can pose a threat overnight, occasionally surprising the Smiths in the Scarlet
Mountains, who have taken to setting up traps to finish them off. Fortunately,
they are very noisy and never stalk their prey, so they rarely manage to cause
too much trouble for the Smiths.
