The oceans hide many mysteries. In them lie innumerable treasures, lost
islands full of unimaginable riches, and terrible curses. They gave rise to
incredible stories and legends. People, especially pirates, believed in the sea
as a deity. In some way, their faith and the magic hidden in the depths of the
waters gave life to Friden. The God of the Sea enjoys stories about the courage
of adventurers, and often communicates with them to encourage them, give
them advice and acknowledge their feats.
