Hydras protect large bastions that Vulcanar had built in Great Pandemonium a
long time ago. The Gad of Fire created these creatures with the purpose of
attracting adventurers and bounty hunters, who expect something valuable to
be hidden in a building guarded by such a large creature. The first time
someone managed to reach the depths of one of these fortresses, he found a
chest with a note inside, which simply said 'Sucker'.
