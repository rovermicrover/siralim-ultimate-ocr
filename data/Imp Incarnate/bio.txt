The legend of the Imp Incarnate says that this creature will unite all the Imps
and lead them to glory. This is actually more a joke than a legend, or so some
believed. When an old ruler of Siralim declared war on the rest of Rodia, a
bright-eyed Imp appeared near some of the towns and cities that had been
invaded and could no longer defend themselves. Along with a horde of Imps,
this little joke has already plundered several human settlements and does not
seem to be stopping soon.
