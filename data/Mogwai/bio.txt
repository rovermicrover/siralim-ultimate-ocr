A group of veteran explorers found a frozen creature one day while traveling
through the Frostbite Caverns in Sithicus. They took it with them and built a
camp. While they debated about its possible species around the bonfire, the
black of ice began to crack and the creature emerged. They did not understand
how it could have survived or how the ice had broken, but it seemed like a kind
and loving creature, so the explorers went to sleep without a worry. Upon
awakening, they realized the creature had stolen all their money, as well as
important tools and climbing gear. With great difficulty, they returned to the
capital and looked for information about what had happened to them. They had
been lucky. A student at the Magic University of Andolin explained that the
creature was believed to be extinct, in part because its extermination had been
ordered. This creature is kind and gentle while it is cold, and it can use ice to
enter a state of stasis indefinitely, but when it gets warm it becomes a deceitful,
malicious being who sometimes kills others for fun.
