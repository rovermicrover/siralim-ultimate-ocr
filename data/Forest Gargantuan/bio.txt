The size of a Gargantuan is both its greatest advantage and its weak point. On
the one hand, their incredible strength allows them to deliver devastating blows.
On the other, they are easy targets that can fall apart if their legs are damaged.

On the back of the Forest Gargantuan there is a small ecosystem inhabited
mainly by trees, insects and small birds. During battle, it uses the soil and the
rocks on the ground to regenerate any damage.
