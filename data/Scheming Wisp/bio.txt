Adter a preliminary investigation of the Wisps, there are reasons to believe they
are creatures born from the residual energy of all the curses cast since the
creatures of this world began to use magic.

Of all Wisps, the Scheming Wisp takes revenge in the most elaborate ways. A
wealthy citizen of Undolim reported that, after having buried her sister, she
found her body lying in the middle of the hall at night. The body's eyes
suddenly flashed blue and it stood up, pulling a knife from its dress. Although
the woman managed to defend against her sister's possessed body until some
Gargoyles subdued it, the authorities in the capital found out days later that she
had poisoned her sister so she could collect the entire inheritance.
