When the battle between Misery and the ruler of Siralim came to an end, this
creature emerged from the throne room in the ruins of Caedo's castle, where
they had fought their duel. This creature is visible even in the deepest
darkness. The earth trembles constantly around it even when it is not moving. If
it hits the ground with its hands, it can cause large-scale earthquakes that
shake buildings miles away from where it is.
