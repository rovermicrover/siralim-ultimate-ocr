This Golem was recently built to help in the forge, but its lack of technique and
its excessive strength quickly made it clear it is not well-suited for this purpose.
However, in battle it is a threat to be reckoned with. Just one of its blows can
crack a sturdy shield, and its metal armor allows it not to take any damage
from most blows. When it is in trouble, it uses its hammer-shaped hands to
deflect or black its enemiesâ€™ attacks.
