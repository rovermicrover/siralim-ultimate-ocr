About half of William James's fleet was lost in the waters, not because of a
storm, but because of the creature who kept grabbing the ships that survived its
attacks. That forgotten, grotesque beast, larger than any boat, was named the
Shambler Juggernaut after the pirate captain and his comrades finally
managed to subdue it. Soon after landing in Rodia, the captured Juggernaut
they had carried with them laid a clutch of eggs, and the pirates, wanting to
rebuild their fleet, decided to sell them. Like their mother, these new
Juggernauts are fearsome foes both on water and dry land, but also very easy
to tame.
