The Blood Leper is extremely dangerous, as the blood that emanates from its
body transmits the disease to humans who come into contact with it. It is
believed that this creature was once a Chosen of Gonfurian, which would
explain its longevity. It was caught near Crux centuries ago, and then studied at
the Magic University of Andolin. Now, the vaccine is cheaper and available to
everyone. However, this creature escaped after an old ruler of Siralim attacked
the kingdom, and now wanders the country.
