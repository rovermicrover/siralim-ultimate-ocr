A priest learned from the Sphinxes more than any other. Along with one of
them, he developed a curse that he incautiously shared with others. Soon his
betrayal was discovered. He was mummified alive and hit with his own curse.
Then the Sphinxes made their move. They knew that humans were spying on
them and showed them just enough magic to create the mummies, which they
awoke to sow chaos. The Swarm Mummy brought terrible hardship to Kaito
and served the Sphinxes in their conquest of the Empire.
