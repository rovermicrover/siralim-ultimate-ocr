Thousands of years ago, Krakens were the greatest danger in the deep,
relegating the Revenants to living in ocean caves and crevices to survive their
constant attacks. Over time, the Revenants' weapons and techniques allowed
them turn things around, so now Krakens only see them as emergency food,
not to be taken lightly.

The Ironside Kraken's shell is so hard that the Revenants stopped using metals
and minerals for their weapons and armor after they learned how to deal with
these creatures. Some of their buildings are also made out of these shells.
