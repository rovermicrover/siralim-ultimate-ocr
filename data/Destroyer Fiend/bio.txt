Fiends hate the outdoors, as well as temperate and cold climates, so they are
rarely seen near human towns and cities. They prefer to live underground, next
to a source of intense heat.

The howl of a Destroyer Fiend turns its packmates into ferocious hunters. It has
recently been discovered that this howl also arouses the predator instinct of any
creature nearby. This effect can override the learned behavior of beasts raised
in captivity, especially when feeding.
