Most Elves spend their lives among their own, but not all of them prefer life in
the forest. Some become mercenaries, bandits or just ordinary citizens in
human settlements. Jingle Elves, however, did not decide to abandon their
people but were exiled by them. The rest of the Elves consider these creatures
abominations, mistakes of nature. Any plants around them, even the largest
trees, wither and die as if the Jingle Elves were involuntarily absorbing their
energy, and their presence even seems to disrupt the rituals of the Elf Mystics.
Despite everything, Jingle Elves overcome adversity and prosper in society
outside the Cutthroat Jungle, often acting as minstrels for the great sovereigns
of the different kingdoms of the world.
