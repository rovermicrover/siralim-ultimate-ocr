With its face hidden behind a bandana and its hat leaning forward, the Skeleton
Gunslinger is able to sneak into a city unnoticed, even when it is under heavy
guard. It looks for strong opponents worthy of using its rifles and challenges
them to a duel in the middle of the road, and it usually wins. When it needs
money, it usually robs large mansions, city halls, or any building that looks
profitable enough.
