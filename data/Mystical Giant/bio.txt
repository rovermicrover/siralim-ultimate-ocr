Adter creating the Apocalypses, Vulcanar appeared before Torun and showed
him one, stating that no Giant could destroy as many Watchers as his "little
girl". That infuriated the God of Anger, who was already furious to begin with,
so he challenged Vulcanar to a duel between his final Giant and whatever
"PIECE OF !@#$" the Elemental King wanted. This is how the Mystical Giant
was born, a 35-foot Giant with skin as hard as steel and the strength of a
seventeen-ton killing machine.
