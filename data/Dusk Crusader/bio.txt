Crusaders are not self-aware. They are guided by a natural instinct that leads
them to carry out their actions.

Dusk Crusaders are active at night, flying low in search of evildoers. After the
Unification War, the council of Rodia entrusted Helmholtz's team with the
"Night Watch" prcject. It was a great success, and since then several patrols of
Dusk Crusaders fly over the towns and cities of the country at night to
safeguard order.
