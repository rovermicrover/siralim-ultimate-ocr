Iconus is a magical creature created by the Auditors, whose sole purpose in life
is to carry out their plans. The inside of its body mainly consists of gears and
metal tubes, through which flows a liquid brimming with magic that must be
replaced every so often. Its skills in battle make it a precise and practically
infallible killing machine, capable of adapting to all kinds of situations as long as
it does not act alone. That is why, when the Auditors entrust it with a mission, it
is always accompanied by five other creatures, usually war-trained Carnages
and Fiends.
