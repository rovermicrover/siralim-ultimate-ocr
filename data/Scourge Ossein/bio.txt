There is some debate about the possibility of certain creatures, such as
Golems and Osseins, being sentient. The latter species also shows behaviors
that contradict its supposed automaton nature. This is more pronounced in the
Scourge Ossein now that a few specimens have begun to live in more diverse
environments that look nothing like the Titan's Wound. This breed prefers to

live in forests and reefs full of life, which it never attacks under any
circumstances, even when it is sometimes bitten or clawed at. However,
anyone who threatens these ecosystems will meet a premature and bloody end.
