Fae are peaceful and joyful creatures who do not know envy or greed. They are
intelligent and help any creature who needs it... as long as it is not the prey of
another Fae.

The most aggressive Fae are undoubtedly Roseae fae. Not only are they the
first to go on the attack, but they also lead the others into battle and continually
shout to boost the morale of all their allies.
