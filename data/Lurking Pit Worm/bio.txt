When the Lurking Pit Worm chooses a victim, it does not stop until it is
devoured. Unlike the rest of its kind, this creature attacks even the most
populated cities. It may choose a traveler on the road, a woodcutter in the
forest, a fisherman in the river. It follows the vibrations of their steps to their
home. Then, in the darkness of the night, when all movements have stopped,
the Lurking Pit Worm slowly emerges from the ground in its prey's bedroom
and swallows them whole.
