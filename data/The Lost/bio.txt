The Auditors are a group of unknown individuals who have been safeguarding
the stability of the world for centuries. Their existence is considered a myth,
and rumors suggest that their members have found the key to eternal life. The
organization's network of contacts is broad enough to have executors in every
continent, and though they usually are not formal members of the organization,
they are also granted the gift of eternal life on rare occasions. When the
Auditors decide to recruit an asset, and he or she refuses to appear before
them, The Lost takes action. This creature appears during the night to subdue
and gag the "interested party‚Äù with its extraordinary strength. The Lost was
exiled centuries ago by its own kind, whose only habitat is on an island lost in
the depths of the Golden Sea.
