The God of Fire is the biggest prankster of the Gods. Torun hates his attitude,
and they have developed a certain rivalry over the years, though Vulcanar has
never taken it too seriously. When Vulcanar created the Pandemonium
Tokens, he included the possibility of summoning Torun just to annoy him.
Throughout history, many creatures have tried to overthrow the Elemental
King. However, they never succeed, and its inhabitants now understand that he
is the one and only ruler of the underworld.
