Osseins are relentless destroyers who at all times need to suppress their urges
to attack all the creatures around them. For this reason, they generally wander
alone through the Titan's Wound.

If it can, the Igneous Ossein spends most of its time under the blood of this
realm, stalking prey that goes near the shore. That is why its body is on fire, as
the temperature of this liquid is higher than lava's. This creature's fire is not
extinguished even after its death, which seems to be related to the strange
nature of the Titan.
