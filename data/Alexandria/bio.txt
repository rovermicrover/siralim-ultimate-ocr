Damarel is a realm full of steam-powered machinery that works with pinpoint
precision. Alexandria spends most of his time thinking about how to improve it
and ensuring it does not fail, but now that his realm has become accessible, his
focus is on outsiders. He is generally hostile to visitors, but if any of them help
protect his home, he wilk gladly reward their actions. The God of Falsity is
extremely literal, unable to understand metaphors or sarcasm. Indeed, talking
to him can be very dangerous unless words are measured correctly.
