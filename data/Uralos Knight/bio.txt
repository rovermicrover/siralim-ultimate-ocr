The Uraloses are widely known throughout Rodia for living in the only place in
the country that has never been conquered. This is because the Uraloses
themselves have prevented it since time immemorial.

When Uraloses go to war, their front lines, at least the ones their enemies can
perceive, always include a battalion of Uralos Knights. Their loyalty to their
people is perhaps too strong, and they have never looked favorably upon those
of their kind who deal peacefully with other species.
