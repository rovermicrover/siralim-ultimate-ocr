There are numerous stories about lucky items and animals, and enough proof
to know most of them are just stories. However, the Squash is an exception to
the rule. Like most Dumplings, these creatures are very elusive. However,
those who obtain one are undoubtedly blessed with good luck. It is as if the
universe conspired so that everything that happens around this creature ends
well for those nearby, which has led to terrible stories about the consequences
of eating a Squash, as well as explanations from more skeptical people who
think the Squash simply affects the world around it with some sort of magic.
