During the winter festivities, many people around the world decorate a fir so
that it resembles an Evergreen Ent. These creatures live in snowy places and
never stray too far from home. If they see a stranger attacking an animal, they
sink their roots in the snow and extend them to deliver a surprise blow to the
aggressor.
