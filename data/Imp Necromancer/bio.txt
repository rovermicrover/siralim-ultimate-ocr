Imp settlements are mainly found in the Faraway Enclave and the Cutthroat
Jungle. Large families of them lived piled up in small cabins, and their main
entertainment is inventing disputes with their closest neighbors.

In their culture, those who can make the dead walk are known as
Necromancers. The truth is that these creatures could not resurrect even a
withered tree. However, they have a wide knowledge about healing herbs that
allows them to heal most common diseases.
