Centuries after the disease first appeared, a scientist from Caedo discovered
that it spread through the blood and wounds of Lepers, but one hundred years
would still have to pass before a vaccine was developed.

The Leper Plaguespreader gives off a nauseating odor that weakens anyone
not used to it. Moreover, it is a vector of a large number of diseases, so the
many kingdoms of Radia offer small bounties for both Plaguespreaders and
Blightbringers.
