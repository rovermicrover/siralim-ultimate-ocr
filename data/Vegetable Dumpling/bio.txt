The meat of a Dumpling is delicious, no matter how it is cooked. Only the
wealthiest can afford to eat them, and few mercenaries have the skill required
to catch them. In addition, they have a sixth sense that warns them of any
danger, so traps are often a better option than direct confrontation. The
Vegetable Dumpling is even harder to find, and it may even be the rarest
creature in the world. Whoever catches one should know that their expertise as
a warrior and adventurer is unparalleled.
