Most Shapeshifters are peaceful and do not feel any misgivings toward
strangers who enter their territory. When they reach a certain age, they
specialize in a certain class of transformations to optimize the results.

Some Shapeshifters act as shamans in their cultures. They talk to their people
about life and death, and guide and motivate them in their day-to-day life.
When they enter battle, they transform into unnatural creatures that should not
be alive.
