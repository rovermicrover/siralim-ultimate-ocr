These creatures inhabit a series of hidden tunnels found in the Arachnid Nest
and, as with the Nix, males of this species are prohibited from leaving their
home. Females are exceptional hunters and their preferred prey is the
Arachnalisks. It is not uncommon for Grubettes to leave the Arachnid Nest, but
when they do they only visit large cities to trade with other creatures. Since they
do not have vocal cords, they communicate with other intelligent species
through hand gestures. Once they finish trading, they immediately return home.
