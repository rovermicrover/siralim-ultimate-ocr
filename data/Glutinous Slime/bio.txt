The Slimes have different abilities depending on the type of magic that
generated the waste they came from.

The Glutinous Slime's body acts as a catalyst for spells. Although absorbing
spells can damage its structure, it does not seem to mind, and always
intercepts them to channel their energy and share it with its allies, making them
more powerful.
