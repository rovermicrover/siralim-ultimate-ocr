This creature often roams graveyards and hides in holes it digs itself or on the
roof of crypts until no noise is heard. Then it leaves its hiding place and looks
for recent tombs to feed on the flesh of the newly buried corpses. Like the rest
of its species, it has a nose for magic that sometimes makes it behave
aggressively when it encounters a Mage.
