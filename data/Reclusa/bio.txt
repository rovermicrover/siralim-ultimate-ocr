Even though everyone knows that she is really the Goddess of Luck, she
prefers the term "Uncertainty" simply because she thinks it sounds more
mysterious and cool. Her realm has been visited since practically the very first
moment it was created, and it quickly became famous since, in short, it is a
casino. Her games of chance have raised controversy among the different
nations of the world, and some recommend their citizens not to try their luck at
the games of chance that proliferate there. Of course, there is no shortage of
thieves and murderers there, but most criminals follow a code dictated
centuries ago by a famous pirate named Rainer that forbids crime in Reclusa's
domain on pain of death.
