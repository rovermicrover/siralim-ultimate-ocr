This creature can channel the cold of the Frostbite Caverns through its blows to
freeze its prey. It is a peaceful creature that lives in the snow and does not look
for trouble, but faced with the arrival of explorers that are scared by its
presence and hunters who seek its skin, it often has to look for allies to get by.
At times, it is deceived by other creatures into forming a group, and at nightfall
they end its life to get some money out of its coat.
