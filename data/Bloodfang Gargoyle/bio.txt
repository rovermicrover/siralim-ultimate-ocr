In the beginning, Gargoyles were just sculptures that adorned temples in the
big cities and served to drain their roofs. Nowadays, they are guardians of the
night that keep the citizens safe from evil creatures.

Bloodfang Gargoyles can change colors to look like ordinary sculptures. As the
inhabitants of Rodia have learned that not all carvings are what they seem,
many warriors have begun to destroy them preemptively, causing a great
damage to the country's cultural heritage.
