This creature is not native to the country of Radia, but a couple of decades ago
it was introduced into one of its ecosystems by accident. River eels are their
favorite delicacy and they know very well how to get hold of them, which very
quickly has become an environmental problem, as these animals already had
natural predators in that environment. The kingdom of Neralim was
overwhelmed by this threat and had to ask the council for help four years ago,
so today there is a group of hunters who have specialized in killing this species.
