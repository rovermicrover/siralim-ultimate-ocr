Leeches only need to touch a creature to absorb its blood. This process occurs
at an incredible speed, and they are able to drain a human being dry in a
matter of minutes.

Being in the presence of the Toxic Leech for too long alters protein synthesis in
any living creature, including magical ones, which ends up killing them unless
they receive proper treatment in time.
