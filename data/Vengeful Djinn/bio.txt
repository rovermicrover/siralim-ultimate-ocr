When the Bjinns rebelled, they did not do it alone. A large number of Magi,
completely deranged, created two terrible creatures. The Vengeful Bjinn was to
be the ultimate Djinn, a being imbued with the power of a Nether Orb that
would punish the humans who tried to enslave them. However, they were
forced to stop its creation before it was ready. The result was a vile, ghostly
entity that materialized the deepest fear of whoever was in front of it, even if it
was another Djinn or a creature.
