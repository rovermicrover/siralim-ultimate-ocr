Slimes are not born evil, but they like to playfully cast spells at each other. They
are not seen as a threat in most cities, and the authorities allow them to move
around the streets freely as long as their numbers are not alarming. If they are,
it usually means some kind of illegal magic activity is taking place, which puts
law enforcement into action.

The Mercurial Slime likes to play with stray animals, and sometimes steals
food from houses to feed them.
