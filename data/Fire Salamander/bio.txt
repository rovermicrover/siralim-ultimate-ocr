The Nether Orbs that helped an old ruler of Siralim attain godhood also granted
the Salamanders extraordinary magic abilities.

Fire Salamanders like to make their nests in the Great Pandemonium. They
can walk on lava without harm, so they generally lay their eggs on islets
surrounded by this dangerous substance. If a flying creature tries to approach,
the Fire Salamander spits fire at it to knock it down, where it dies to the heat of
the magma. Vulcanar quickly became an admirer of these creatures.
