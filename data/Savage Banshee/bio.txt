This creature emerged from the pieces of the first God of Darkness's skull.
Unlike other Banshees, it is very aggressive and tries to destroy everything in
its path. Its screams can stop the heart of a weak-willed person, and a touch of
its hand leads even the happiest people to despair. Aware of the danger this
creature posed, Erebyss decided to destroy it. However, it has managed to
regenerate over the centuries, and soon the time will come for it to sow chaos
in Rodia.
