The only ones who had the privilege of being mummified were usually the
sovereigns of Kaito, once they exhaled their last breath. However, there was a
punishment reserved for a few in a which a traitor was condemned to be
mummified in life, along with many other hardships.

The Nightmare Mummies dealt with the priests and priestesses of Kaito. When
their spells hit the dark bandages, a strange purple halo appeared that
absorbed the magic, leaving them powerless to face the creatures.
