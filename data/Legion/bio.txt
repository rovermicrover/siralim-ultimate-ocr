During battles, especially in conflicts between armies, innumerable injuries of
all kinds happen, and many of them involve severed limbs. One day, a Mage
came up with the idea of taking advantage of this fact to create creatures that
would join the ranks of the side for which he was fighting. The result was
Legion, a creature who obeys the orders of its master, capable of fighting
relentlessly for days. Although in the past these creatures could only be created
with recently severed flesh, magic has advanced enough to be able to use the
flesh of corpses a few days old.
