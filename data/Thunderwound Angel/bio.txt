Beams of electricity traverse the Thunderwound Angel's body continously.
Touching this creature is dangerous, since they can produce discharges
powerful enough to burn a small animal to a crisp. In battle, they summon a
spear made of electricity that pierces through swords, shields, and armor,
unless they were properly enchanted to resist it.
