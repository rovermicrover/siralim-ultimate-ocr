Though it once served as Zonte's personal familiar, the all-too-curious god
granted Elqor's request for the freedom to explore the world on its own. The
mental bond between Zonte and Elgor still remains, however, and the two often
hold trivial conversations and share their discoveries with each other just like
the good old days. Some time ago, the Auditors contacted it and it had an
audience with one of their members. Due to its incredible potential, it was
offered a position as executor, but Elqor politely declined the offer and went
back the way it had come.
