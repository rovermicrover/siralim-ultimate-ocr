These individuals arrived in Rodia not long ago, in a large fleet of ships that
was stranded on the coast after a heavy storm. They come from a very distant
and completely unknown land, and their body is devoid of flesh and organs due
to a curse they received on an island full of ancient treasures. They usually
attack from a distance with technology that does not exist in this country, and
though the shots of the Skeleton Sniper are not exactly deadly, they do have a
long range.
