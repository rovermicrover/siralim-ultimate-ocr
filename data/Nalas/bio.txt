Fae always travel in groups, except if they are with a Brave. Their coordination
is perfect and they can separate to make surprise attacks using bait, or attack
from two different flanks to confuse their enemies, not letting them react to the
attack properly. Nalas, Shallan's right hand, is in charge of settling conflicts
among the Fae when they cannot solve them on their own.
