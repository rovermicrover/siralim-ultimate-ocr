Erebyss hid the Nephilim in the deepest recesses of the Path of the Damned
for thousands of years, to prevent them from unleashing chaos among mortals.
All Nephilim are dangerous, but the Lord seems to go even further. It does not
usually target ordinary people, not even those who devote their lives to helping
others. The Nephilim Lord prefers its victims to be powerful, influential people.
A single wound from its sword will turn them into complete lunatics who will, for
example, subtly unleash a plan to plunge their own nations into misery.
