The Apis were turned into loyal beasts by the Sphinx Usurper, able to face
danger. In exchange, they lost their power over the earth and the sun.
However, adding the strength of the Apis to the battle against the Watchers
was not enough to change the fate of the empire. The Apis Warrior, made by
the Usurper to protect it, knew that it was fighting for a lost cause and rebelled
to free its people. The Apis turned against the Sphinxes, who could not prevent
their escape on the last day of Kaito.
