Imlings are extremely fragile creatures who can barely lift any weight and often
contract diseases. Imlers feel a strong need to watch over them for this reason,
and the Imlings greatly appreciate it.

The Tainted Imling's cells were severely altered by magic during its
development. Its smell is intense and unpleasant, and its fluids are corrosive to
most creatures. In addition, its structure is so fragile that a strong magic shock
can suddenly alter it and turn this creature into an Imler.
