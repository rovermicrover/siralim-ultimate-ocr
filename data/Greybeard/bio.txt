These dogs are the guardians of an order of Magi from the kingdom of Ercath.
Their cloaks and staves are their hallmarks, and they have been infused with
magic in such a way that they have acquired certain peculiarities. They are
capable of finding any member of the order as long as they are within a ten
miles radius, and they perceive the presence of intruders within their
headquarters from the moment they set foot inside it. At that moment, the pack
goes on the attack while barking to alarm the members of the order.
