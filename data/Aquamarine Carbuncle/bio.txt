Carbuncles are elusive, easily frightened creatures, though not by nature. In
ancient times, humans discovered that the gem on their forehead has the
ability to store spells, which can then be used by anyone with practically no
limitations.

Any magic item around an Aquamarine Carbuncle gets slightly colder and
gives off specks of blue light that are more visible the closer the item is to the
creature. Unlike the rest of their kind, Aquamarine Carbuncles do not dislike
water and sometimes they even enjoy shaking themselves next to others of
their species while they are wet.
