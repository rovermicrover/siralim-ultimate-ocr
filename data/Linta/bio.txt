Linta was Hexilo's assistant long before he became Mortem. Hexilo and his
best friend River gave life to this creature and hid it from everyone. Otherwise,
it would have been destroyed, and they would have been expelled, as this type
of magic was forbidden without a permit, especially to students. For years, the
two friends believed they were hiding their secret well, until a promising new
student visited the facilities, shortly before they graduated. The little boy stared
at the spot in Hexilo's bedroom where he had hidden it with an invisibility spell.
That could have meant anything, especially in the bedroom of a Magi student,
but the little boy felt a strange presence and began to cast a spell of Dispel.
Luckily, before he could finish, Hexilo grabbed him by the arm and led him to
the common room to taste the blueberry pie his schoolmates had prepared.
There, the boy brought up the sutject of the bedroom again. "Zonte! Be more
respectful of your elders!" his mother exclaimed. Everyone laughed except that
boy. Two months later, Hexilo left the Refuge of Magi, taking Linta with him,
and it remained at his side even after he went into the Titan's Wound.
