This creature is Aurum's right hand, although it does not play a significant role
in the decisions made by the God of Vanity. Its role is to ensure everything is in
order in the Temple of Lies, but now, with the realm invaded by countless
threats, it is overwhelmed and remains motionless, as its decision-making
system is very limited. Fed up with its obvious incompetence, Aurum has
ordered it to just remain still. However, when faced with intruders, it must
solemnly communicate that, at any moment, death will be applied to them for
desecrating the land of the supreme God Aurum.
