Despite the rebellionâ€™s success and the abolition of slavery, illegal Brownie
trafficking still exists. This despicable practice is persecuted by the authorities,
but that is not always enough. The Brownie Loner is a hero known among its
own people, a veteran warrior who secretly investigates these activities, goes
into the lairs of the criminals and defeats them with its bow. In cities such as
Nex and Vanelin, it is rewarded for its services, though it always shares the
money with the poor.
