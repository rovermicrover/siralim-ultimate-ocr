It can be said that Taylor was the first human to create a creature, as Clutchers
were the first species not to be engendered by the Gods. The Static Clutcher
was his first great success, an obedient being who followed him everywhere
and inspired fear in his sutjects. He used it to punish those who did not follow
his orders to the letter. This creature would grab its victims' faces and emit a
painful discharge that burned their bodies and sometimes even killed them.
