In the middle of battle, Kolosses can add extra tissue to their puppets to make
them harder to take down. It is currently believed that this ability could have
medical uses.

Night Kolosses, named so by a human adventurer, are good leaders, but they
stand out most of all for their ability to understand the emotions of their peers.
Most of them use this advantage to improve their quality of life, but some
others, more ambitious and devious, prefer to manipulate them in order to gain
power.
