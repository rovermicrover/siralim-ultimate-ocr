Reapers are intelligent beings who know all kinds of languages. However, they
consider the concerns of mortals trivial and rarely communicate with them.

It is believed that the Shadow Reapers are the purest of their species. When
their scythes take a life before its time had come, they generate a space-time
distortion that accelerates the aging process of any creatures around them.
During his investigations, Zonte designed a spell to reverse this effect.
