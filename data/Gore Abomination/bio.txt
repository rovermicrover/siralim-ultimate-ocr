Abominations keep some parts of their true identity, although they have lost
most of their memories. Both heads can access the other's mind to know what
they think at all times.

When the God of Punishment is in a hurry to create more Abominations, the
result is usually a Gore Abomination. This creature has an unusual amount of
blood in it, which erupts from its body when it receives damage.
