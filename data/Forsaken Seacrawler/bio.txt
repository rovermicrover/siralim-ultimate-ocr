The city of Omnia had engineering works that seemed to be taken from a
dream. The floating lake, where a large number of marine creatures were
displayed, was one of the most popular tourist attractions. During the
Unification War, the enchanted mechanisms that supported the lake were
damaged, and it began to move freely around the city. The women who
drowned inside transformed into Seacrawlers, creatures that can quickly move
underwater and drown anyone who comes into contact with them.
