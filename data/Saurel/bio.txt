These creatures are the only ones Reclusa has given life to, and they are found
throughout the Gambler's Hive. Their main job is to work as dealers, and they
will not hesitate to punish anyone who cheats, sparks altercations or shows
violent discontent. They are quiet and extremely serious, and rarely
communicate for anything other than the games they run. In their spare time,
they read and discuss various topics with other Saurel. Many of them have
written books and poems, some of them famous in nations like Rodia or
Kiaces, to the point of being among the best sellers.
