Grimoires can be used by humans and other creatures who can use magic to
cast the spells they contain.

There was once a Mage in the Columbia Tower who secretly compiled a series
of dangerous curses in one of the Grimoires. That must have attracted the
attention of Apollinaire and awoken it from its slumber, as it ripped half of the
Necro Grimoire's pages before leaving the tower.
