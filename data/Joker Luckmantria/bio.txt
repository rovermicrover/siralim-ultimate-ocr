Luckmantrias flap their wings slowly, but they move much faster than one
might imagine, as the wind apparently wants to help them by flowing in their
favor at all times.

Unlike the rest of its kind, the Joker Luckmantria does not bother camouflaging
itself to hide the fact that luck is on its side. This creature flutters freely
wherever it pleases, letting itself be seen at all times, and even letting the
universe cause earthquakes if necessary to prevent being captured.
