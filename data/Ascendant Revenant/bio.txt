Ascendant Revenants never use melee weapons in battle. They are great
engineers who learned to use gunpowder in a continent far from Radia, as well
as a real pain in the neck for the authorities. Although, luckily, they are few in
number, these creatures cause so much damage that those who live to tell the
tale always describe it as "unfair." Their enemies either explode or are cut
down by the Revenant's companions while trying to tear the devices from their
bodies. After the war ends, Rodia's council will make it a top priority to find a
way to reduce the damage these contraptions cause in battle.
