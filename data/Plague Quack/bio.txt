Plague Doctors are shy and quiet, and rarely communicate with other
creatures. They sometimes make gestures with their hands or move their
heads in a certain direction to point out materials and tools they need.

The Plague Quack hates fake doctors. It travels through towns and cities
looking for possible frauds, and when it finds one it simply heals the sick people
and disappears before the patientsâ€™ family members unleash their anger on the
imposter.
