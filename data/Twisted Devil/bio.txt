Whenever a human murders another in cold blood, a Twisted Devil is born in
the Torture Chamber. It spends its youth tormenting the condemned with blows
and superficial cuts of small weapons, but as an adult it wanders Rodia and
other countries to continue its misdeeds. If it survives long enough, its
techniques become more devious and less reckless, abandoning robberies and
random attacks to devote itself to organized crime.
