Although Abominations seem to lead an extremely painful and unbearable
existence, the truth is that they do not feel pain or sadness. These creatures
live in a state of perpetual obtundation and calm, and they are rather given to
slouching in the shade without doing anything.

Wandering Abominations especially prefer to ignore conflicts and devote
themselves to contemplating the landscape in silence. Unfortunately, many
criminal bands enslave them and force them to work.
