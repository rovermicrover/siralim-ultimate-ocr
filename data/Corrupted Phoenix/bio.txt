Phoenixes are mystical creatures that can influence the life and death of other
beings.

During the Unification War, Egas the Necromancer corrupted a large number of
Phoenixes with a dark ritual to help him in his conquest. The presence of these
creatures prevented the resurrection attempts of enemy creatures. When
Helmholtz defeated the Necromancer, the Phoenixes escaped his control and
spread throughout the country. They are currently peaceful creatures that feed
on carrion.
