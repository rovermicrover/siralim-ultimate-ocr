Dryads are linked to the oak from which they came. Dryads receive any
damage made to their tree, which causes them pain. In the same way, healing
the wounds of a Dryad also regenerates her tree.

Aeolian put special effort when creating the Dryad Raincallers. When the
drought becomes an obstacle to the regeneration of a devastated forest, they
perform a beautiful dance that summons the Storms. These creatures release
their water where the Dryads believe it is most necessary.
