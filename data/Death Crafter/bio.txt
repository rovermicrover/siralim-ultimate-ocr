These Smiths use dark arts to imbue their weapons with a corrupt power that
increases the strength of their alliesâ€™ artifacts. It is a ritual that requires the
sacrifice of a member of the Smith species. In the past, there were always
volunteers among those who had lost their families and those who had nothing
left but an empty, broken heart. These days, Death Crafters only sacrifice the
Smiths who renounce their lives in the Scarlet Mountains or the Gorgon
colonies.
