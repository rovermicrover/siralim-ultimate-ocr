If an Animation takes damage, the necromancer who created it will feel a
shooting pain in the same part of the body the Animation was made from.

When a Hand Animation spends too much time idle, their fingers begin to tap
against the surface they are on. On one occasion, a necromancer who was in
the Great Pandemonium watched as one of these creatures was consumed by
the lava when it carried out this movement.
