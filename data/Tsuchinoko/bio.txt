The bite of a Tsuchinoko is not as dangerous as that of other animals in the
world, but its effects are quite curious. Rodia's biologists have not yet reached
a conclusion about the creature's origin, though the most supported theory
suggests they could have appeared because of a magic accident in which one
or more Alementals had been involved. Anyone bitten by a Tsuchinoko will be
inoculated with enough alcohol to get an elephant drunk.
