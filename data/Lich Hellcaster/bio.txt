When a large number of Liches gather, it is usually with a destructive purpose.
In such occasions, a Lich Hellcaster will put its fiery hand on the top of its staff
and then anoint the other Liches one by one. The process seems to stoke this
creature's flames. Like other Liches, it has a ghostly voice, and when the wind
blows strongly through the bony cavities of its skull, gloomy sounds can be
heard over the rustle of its tunic.
