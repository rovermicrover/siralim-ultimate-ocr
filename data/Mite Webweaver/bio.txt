This creature is responsible for one of the most unpleasant landscapes in the
country. Like Arachnalisks, Mites reach peaks of overpopulation once or twice
a century. When the forests of Radia are completely tangled in cobwebs, a
disgusting sight that causes serious damage to ecosystems, it means it is time
for the authorities to take measures. Its silk also allows it to survive in extreme
environments and to immobilize its enemies.
