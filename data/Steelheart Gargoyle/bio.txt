This creature is not really a Gargoyle, but an automaton that responds to the
Auditorsâ€™ orders. The barrier that protects the city of Ubi Concordia also hides it
from view and magical scrying, although an extremely powerful Mage could
bypass all these protections. If an intruder were to enter the city, the Steelheart
Gargoyle would take flight and plummet on its target, spinning like a whirlwind
to rip them apart with the edge of its pointed wings.
