Wolpertingers only use their claws and fangs when they hunt. However, during
their mating rituals, both females and males use their horns to fight their
counterparts and choose the most appropriate partner.

Viridian Wolpertingers are the most patient of their kind. They are discreet, and
that makes them the most dangerous. They use their color to camouflage
themselves in the meadow without being detected, simply waiting until prey
approaches to go for the throat.
