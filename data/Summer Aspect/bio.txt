When the summer sun warms the rivers and lakes of Radia, a hand, covered in
algae, emerges from the water and falls heavily on the shore to help the
Summer Aspect rise to the surface. People already used to this event tend to
ignore the creatures, but children usually flee in terror when they see them
while their parents laugh in the background. They are known to summon a
breeze that relieves the heat of the most suffocating summer days.
