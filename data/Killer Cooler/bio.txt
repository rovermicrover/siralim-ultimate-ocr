This creature can withstand extremely low temperatures and constantly
generates cold when it opens its jaws. Its breath is not cold enough to freeze a
person, but being around one can be unbearable without the right clothes and
even lead to hypothermia. However, as this is a Mimic subspecies, that person
would likely end up in its stomach (or whatever it has in its place) long before it
could die from the cold.
