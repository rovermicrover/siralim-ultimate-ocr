Cerberuses are aggressive and restless creatures by nature, but they can be
trained from a young age to obey orders and remain calm.

The Caustic Cerberus constantly oozes a corrosive liquid capable of burning
through steel. This is creature is especially dangerous to anyone nearby when
it runs or shakes itself, since the acid splashes everywhere and a single drop
can take out an eye.
