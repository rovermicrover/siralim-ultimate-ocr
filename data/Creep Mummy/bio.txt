Magic was discovered during the rise of the first civilizations in the Kaito
Empire, far from the green meadows and cold mountains. Tradition dictated
that the kings and queens of that place had to undergo a ritual related to the
afterlife.

A sticky liquid drips constantly from the Creep Mummy's bandages. To kill
humans, this creature placed its hand on their faces to prevent them from
breathing or opening their eyelids.
