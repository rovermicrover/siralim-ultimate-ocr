The Magic University of Vanelin recently developed a prcject with a group of
engineers from Kiaces that finally allowed access to Damarel. They quickly
realized that the Clockworks weren't exactly happy to see creatures from
outside.

If anyone could have seen Damarel a year before, they might have thought
both War and Battle Clockworks were mere ornaments... or warriors waiting for
battle to begin. With the arrival of outsiders, War Clockworks have begun to
move and can be found throughout the realm of the God of Falsity, ensuring
that nothing interferes with the activities of other Clockworks.
