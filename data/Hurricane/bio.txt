Storms can speak, and they do it all the time, shouting vulgarities over the
constant sound of thunder they emit. In addition, they usually electrocute food
while it is cooking, trying to compete with the fire to see who can make it boil
faster.

When a Hurricane gets angry, it discharges enough electricity to pulverize
creatures the size of a horse, although it prefers inanimate targets like the
wheels of a carriage, stores of magic items, and, of course, chimneys.
