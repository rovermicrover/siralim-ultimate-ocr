A Leper is less than a vestige of the person it once was. Its memories are
blurred dreams, and its thinking is slow and dull. Apparently, Taylor created
them by mistake while trying to figure out how to transform a person into a
Doomguard.

The Leper Blightbringer is a magnet for diseases, due to its weakened immune
system. It is extremely contagious to anyone around it, though prolonged
exposure to the creature produces defenses against its diseases.
