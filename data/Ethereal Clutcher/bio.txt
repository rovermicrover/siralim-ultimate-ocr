Clutchers can sense fear over great distances. Before approaching an
unarmed, terrified victim, they hide and move slowly, scratching the cold stone
with their nails.

The Ethereal Clutcher can prcject terrifying images and scenes into people's
minds, even when they are asleep. When Tartarith is especially busy "DOING
THE KILLING", he orders these creatures to have fun with his future victims.
