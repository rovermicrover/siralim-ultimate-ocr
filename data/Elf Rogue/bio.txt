Elves do not live forever, and the older they get, the more vulnerable to disease
they become. However, their longevity is legendary, and some even live
beyond a thousand years of age.

Elves are also extremely agile and clever, and Elf Rogues are trained to
harness the maximum potential of their bodies. They move stealthily in the
shadows and determine their enemiesâ€™ movements while looking for the right
moment to strike a mortal blow.
