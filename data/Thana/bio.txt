The Goddess of Earth has multiple ‘granddaughters’ shaped from the stone
and dirt and given life, who assist her in maintaining the balance within the
Forbidden Depths. Though there are only nine, among them Thana is a living
legend due to having found a way to bypass the seal on the Forbidden Depths,
and has been known to appear in Vulcanar's realm from time to time, causing
havoc in the fire god's domain.

There are records in the distant past of Thana even visiting the surface once for
a brief time; but as they cannot speak any of the Radian languages, the people
assumed Thana to be a terrible monster and attacked them. Thana retreated to
the Forbidden Depths badly injured and harboring a deep, violent hatred of
humanity that, thus far, they have not acted upon. This is of great concern to
Anneltha, who only entrusts Thana to those who she feels may grant them
more hopeful perspectives.
