Aiter the Watcher War, some of the refugees from Kaito started a new life in
the Unsullied Meadows. Since the Dragons were too busy dealing with the
Watchers, Aeolian was the first to notice their presence... and the first to ask
them to abandon his realm. But he also knew of Kaito's plight, and seeing how
respectful those people had been gave him an idea: he would let them stay for
a generation before making a choice. When the time was up, Aeolian found
that the humans had not only survived while preserving nature, but also
improved the state of his realm wherever they had settled. Those refugees
became the first humans to live in the Unsullied Meadows. In a gesture of
gratitude and praise, Aeolian created the Ovoid Vortex to protect them, inspired
by the Omelettes that lived with the refugees.
