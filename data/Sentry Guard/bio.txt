Five years after the construction of the Torture Chamber, Taylor became
interested in Nether Orbs. He was the first to study them, and he soon received
a visit from Vertraag, who said he was fascinated by his prowess both as a
Mage and a murderer and offered him the opportunity to become a God. In his
arrogance, he accepted, then organized a tournament to celebrate the
occasion. The winner, a veteran warrior from Sithicus, was led to Taylor's
chambers, where he turned him into the Sentry Guard.
