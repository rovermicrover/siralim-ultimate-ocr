Watchers come from a mysterious dimension, which no mortal can access.

The Hell Watcher's innate abilities allow it to channel the energy of the undead
to enhance their spells. When they corner a creature, they dig their claws into
its flesh and take flight, then drop it from a high enough altitude to kill it.
