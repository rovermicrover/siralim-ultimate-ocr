Aja Birku, otherwise known by Radian scholars as The Puzzle Box, is one of
the few creatures that still perplexes even the most devoted of artificers.
According to legend, Aja Birku is the key to visiting parallel dimensions, as it
mysteriously appeared during the Watcher War. Seven centuries ago,
Helmholtz, a prestigious Mage, succeeded in extracting its core, a crystalline
stone he called the Crystal Eye. However, before he could uncover its secrets,
the city of Nex was besieged by Omnia's forces. The attack failed, but what
was their real goal? That night, the Crystal Eye was lost forever.
