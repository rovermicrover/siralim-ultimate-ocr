Warhogs are often used in the illegal creature fights that are held in the slums
of the big cities of Rodia, as well as in territories owned by crime syndicates.

The Barbed Warhog spends up to sixteen hours a day sleeping, hidden under
its spiky carapace. It usually inhabits places where it can easily camouflage
itself, and when it notices prey, it rolls into a ball to run over it from a higher
ground.
