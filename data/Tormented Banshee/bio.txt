Banshees are not intelligent beings, they are guided by their instinct. They
barely need to eat, and they constantly wander as if they had no purpose.

When a catastrophe is about to occur, dozens of Banshees gather around,
creating a chorus of spectral voices.

The Tormented Banshee is welcomed in some towns and cities, as it feeds on
nightmares, especially those of children.
