Luckmantrias have fascinated the Uraloses since the beginning of their
civilization, and there are all kinds of rites and traditions linked to these
creatures in their culture.

Treetops and tall grass are this creature's favorites. On one occasion, a Rodian
had a sudden cramp and fell to the ground in pain. Those who were traveling
with him stopped to help him, while a nearby Club Luckmantria opened its eyes
to find a horse's leg in front of it.
