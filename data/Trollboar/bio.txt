Troll Kings usually die a few years after they reach that position. However,
some of them rule until they become too old, at which point they decide to
abdicate for their own safety... or rather, they are advised to do so. Without
exception, next to these Kings there has always been a Trollboar, a rare
specimen of the species who, despite what its appearance may suggest, is
much more intelligent than the other Trolls and pulls the King's strings from the
shadows.
