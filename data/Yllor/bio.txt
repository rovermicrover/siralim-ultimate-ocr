Yllor, together with Alakadan, used to keep watch over the gates of the Refuge
of the Magi. After the incident that gave birth to the Occultists, Zonte met with
them and offered them freedom, encouraging them to travel the world. The two
creatures looked at each other with a mixture of amazement and fear, but they
finally accepted the offer, in exchange for being able to return to their job during
the winter and "take advantage of the thermal field that surrounds the tower".
Yllor and Alakadan were training in Vanelin with the legendary Red Hat order
when an old ruler of Siralim appeared and took over the kingdom. Yllor is very
temperamental and much naiver than his partner, often starting tavern brawls
when they visit a city.
