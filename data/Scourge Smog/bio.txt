The Smogs are entities blinded by rage, who seek revenge against all the
inhabitants of Rodia. They are a constant problem for the humans and Pilwiz
who work the land, because of the resentment they feel toward these activities.
For their part, farmers especially detest the Scourge Smog, as the red smoke it
emits can quickly dehydrate the crops. Entire harvests have been lost because
of these creatures.
