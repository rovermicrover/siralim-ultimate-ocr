Unlike other Carvers, this creature feels no need to target a large number of
victims in a short time. Instead, it enjoys focusing on a single individual, trying
to keep them alive to inflict the maximum possible suffering. For this reason,
they are commonly employed as interrogators or executioners in some regions
of Rodia, or hired by people who want to settle a score.
