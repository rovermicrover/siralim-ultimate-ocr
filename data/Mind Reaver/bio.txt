Mind reavers are not very different from rhinos. Indeed, they used to be rhinos,
but a Nature Mage who sadly watched as they were hunted indiscriminately
decided to give them a weapon with which to defend themselves. These
creatures coexist with their non-magical siblings, constantly roaming their
territories for the sole purpose of protecting them. If a hunter manages to land a
hit on this creature, even if it is a deadly one, they will lose the will to hunt these
mammals for the rest of their life.
