Crunchers are slow creatures of low intelligence that simply try to eat anything
within their reach. For centuries, this "anything" was either Carbuncles, smaller
Crunchers, or any okject they found in their path.

Possessed Crunchers owe their name to the fact that, when they are asleep,
and they retract their head and legs inside their shell, it rises and moves on its
own, spinning mysteriously. Apparently, this is a defense mechanism to protect
them against predators while they sleep.
