The children of Regalis mainly inhabit the Arachnid Nest, but they have spread
through Rodia and have an ecological niche in mast of the country's
ecosystems.

Spitting Arachnalisks sometimes compete for territory with each other, through
a very particular confrontation. Each contender builds a web in the shape of a
target approximately 10 meters away from its rival, and they take turns to spit
acid on each other's webs until one of them falls.
