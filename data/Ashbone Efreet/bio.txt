Immediately after the Djinn uprising, Vulcanar visited Zonte and his teacher to
propose a deal. Apparently, seeing a Djinn Pyromancer had given him an idea.
In exchange for his help to take back to Refuge of the Magi, they would help
him create the Efreets. As long as there is a fire, the Ashbone Efreet can alter
its movement and duration at will. If it sees a fire break out, it will use its
powers to prevent anyone from extinguishing it.
