It is believed that the Nephilim were released from their prison after recent
events in Rodia, but their numbers were not a cause for concern for the
governments of the different kingdoms, until now.

Unlike other Nephilim, the Skirmisher acts ruthlessly. This creature is a
bloodthirsty assassin who searches for purehearted people for the sole purpose
of bathing its weapon in blood. It prioritizes those with the purest convictions,
but it also attacks even the worst scum, as even they have done good at some
point in their lives.
