Familiars are often hired by small towns and villages to scare away Mutated
Pulse Bats that try to take advantage of the darkness of the night to steal food
from people.

The Flood Familiar can swim and dive in the water, from where it can also
obtain food. In battle, it creates high-density water spheres that it can direct at
will to hit its opponents in unprotected areas.
