A Demented Carver never stops looking for prey. When it finds some, it chops
the poor victims to small pieces it can eat, not caring whether they are dead or
alive during the process. It only collaborates with others when they promise a
great number of victims for it to carve. Extreme caution is advised when
dealing with this creature.
