A Wolpertinger's clutch usually consists of ten eggs. However, the chicks are
extremely violent even at that stage and they kill each other for the food that
their mother brings them. In the end, only one or two reach maturity.

The Volatile Wolpertinger's hind legs are atrophied, so it spends most of its
time in the air or perched on the branches of trees. The experience turns these
creatures into expert air hunters, although a wing injury usually means death
for them.
