Like the rest of the Amaranths, this creature only responds with violence when
it is in danger. By concentrating, it can summon fire from anywhere in the world
and use it against whoever is trying to harm it. Milner and Helmholtz, two
legendary Magi who managed to overcome death, have noticed how the
Amaranths have become more restless with the passage of centuries, and
sightings of them have increased. However, they have not yet found an
explanation for this mystery.
