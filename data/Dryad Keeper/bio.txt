Dryads are denizens of the forest, but some also live in the Cutthroat Jungle
and the Unsullied Meadows. They are active protectors of nature, although they
prefer to use words to persuade those who threaten it.

When tenacious lumberjacks or Flamehook Pilwiz attack a Dryad Keeper after
refusing to stop their activities, her first response is to protect herself with her
shield. If she is attacked again, she uses the orb in her right hand to call on
every nearby creature and annihilate the threat.
