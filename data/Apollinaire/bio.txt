All Rift Dancers hate Magi, but Apollinaire especially so. In ancient times, this
creature attacked a tower inhabited by Magi and annihilated them all, leaving a
terrifying trail of blood and entrails in its ascent. It has been seen touching other
Rift Dancers, making them disappear with a peaceful sigh, as if it allowed them
to return to their own world.
