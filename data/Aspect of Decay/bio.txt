Egas the Necromancer once corrupted some Aspects with his power so they
would fight in his army during the Unification War. However, once Egas was
defeated, they dispersed. They live in places where the land is sterile and the
seasons never seem to alter the climate or the ecosystem much. Some
travelers fear these creatures and run away from their terrifying appearance,
but they are not aggressive creatures.
