Some Imps come to live in towns and cities inhabited by humans and other
intelligent species. There, a few find their way through the teachings of Surathli.
The most fanatical among them are the Imp Bishops, whose purpose is
spreading the word of Light. As expected, their people welcome them with
open arms, arms that hold sacks of rotten fruit to throw at high speeds towards
their faces.
