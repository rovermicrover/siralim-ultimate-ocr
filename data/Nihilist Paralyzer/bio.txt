Nihilists will never attack unless they are in danger, unless their opponent is a
Voidlord. They do not communicate in any way with other creatures, and they
do not need to breathe, feed, or sleep to survive.

The ribbons on this creature's staff are harmless to all except Voidlords. When
they come into contact with these beings, they automatically coil around their
bodies, paralyzing their movements and nullifying their abilities.
