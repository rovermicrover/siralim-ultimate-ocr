King Misery was defeated and killed 723 years ago in the throne room of his
own kingdom, but his thirst for vengeance allowed his spirit to remain in this
world. Caedo, his kingdom, became part of Gonfurian's realm, and from there
he planned his return for centuries. Emlai, the last Caedo Seraph, seeks
retribution for its king, who was crucified as a heretic for the second time so
many years ago by none other than the ruler of Siralim. Emlai's thirst for
vengeance will not be quenched until Siralim, and all the people who
contributed to its king's untimely demise, are wiped from the face of Rodia.
