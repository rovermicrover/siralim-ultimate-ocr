The core of a Phase Warrior is the enchanted stone that makes it a remnant,
always floating over its head. The first stones to be used as a core for these
creatures were part of the castle of Siralim, when it was damaged during a
siege.

Phase Executioners are the remnants of reckless warriors who exposed
themselves in battle to unleash devastating attacks that captured the attention
of their enemies, allowing Magi to use their power freely.
