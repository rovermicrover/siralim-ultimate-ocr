Bards long for the sounds of their "voice" to reach as many people as possible.
However, the effects of their music and their apparent inability to stop their own
mind-affecting traits have led many towns and cities to permanently ban these
creatures.

The songs of the Bard Trovatore ridicule politicians, sometimes with very
well-chosen words. Listening to them produces laughter, but also arouses
feelings of rebellion against authority.
