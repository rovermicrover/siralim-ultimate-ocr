In exchange for losing their eyesight, Terra Vulpes can sense their environment
through the auras that surround all otjects and living things. When they are
hungry, they focus this sixth sense in a small area to detect sources of magic
they can feed on. These creatures were native to the deep forests of Rodia, but
after the events that led to the ascension of an old ruler of Siralim, they can
now be found near towns and cities.
