The steel blade of a Koloss is always sharp, regardless of how many times it
has seen battle. If a Koloss is blunt, it means the creature has died, either in
battle or after its five years of life have come to an end.

Koloss Eradicators are bloodthirsty warriors who show no mercy on the
battlefield. They take the destruction of their enemies so seriously that they are
unable to stop, even when the battle is lost. Interestingly, these creatures are
calm and kind when not in battle, preferring to resolve conflicts by talking things
out.
