The blue flames of the Lich Netherwalker are cold and make no sound. Anyone
who comes into contact with them will see their willpower tested. If they are not
strong enough, they will become this creature's puppet for twenty-four hours.
Unfortunately, once its influence over its victim wanes, it can simply produce
more flames to control them again, repeating the process indefinitely and
turning the victim into a puppet for the rest of their days if it so wishes.
