Their main means of orientation are the electromagnetic waves they emit
automatically at all times. They prefer to hunt at night, when most animals are
asleep, stealthily approaching them to suck their blood. According to biologist
Sprung Helthar, they are extremely aggressive during the mating season, as
their mating ritual consists of biting and clawing at each other to demonstrate
their strength, and they only procreate when they find an equally strong partner.
