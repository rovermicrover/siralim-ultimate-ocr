Adter the war against darkness, the Angels, creatures of blood and steel, lost
their purpose and became lethargic, until the wars of humans caught their
attention.

that submerging them in water was enough to extinguish their flames that
cover their body. However, they only need a few seconds to make them burn
again. Those seconds were what the priest needed to run away before the
Firewound Angel turned him to ashes.
