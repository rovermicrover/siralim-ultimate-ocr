Marine Pit Worms are deep sea creatures who were brought to the mainland
by Revenant raiding parties. In their natural habitat, they feed on all kinds of
creatures, including, of course, the Revenants themselves. Their diet on the
surface is largely the same, and they act like voracious predators to anything
that is not a cat. For unknown reasons, the mere presence of these small
felines provokes an intense feeling of dread in Marine Pit Worms, driving them
to speed away as quickly as they can.
