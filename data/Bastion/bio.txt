The Bastion was created by accident two hundred years ago by a group of
Magi when they tried to fortify the walls of a Rodian castle with spells. The lord
was impressed at first and wanted to add it to his guard, until he discovered
that the creature seemed intent on sheltering and protecting people. The Magi
were immediately expelled from his lands, but they took good note of what
happened and made sure that accident would not be forgotten.
