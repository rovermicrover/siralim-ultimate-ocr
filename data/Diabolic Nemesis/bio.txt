The Diabolic Nemesis is considered a shaman by the members of the Horde. It
often gives advice to its people and speaks to them about the Word of
Gonfurian and their sacred duty of fighting and pillaging. When it knows there is
a difficult fight ahead, it will start a ritual the night before the battle. This ritual
ends with the preparation of a brew to calm the spirit and make it more resilient.
