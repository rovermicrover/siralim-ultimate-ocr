Occasionally, the embryo of a Boulder Imler that is exposed to magic is not
severely affected by it. The result is a cocky, mischievous Imling of greater
physical strength who likes to dig with Imlers, using its powerful horn to remove
dirt and break rocks. Despite its arrogant attitude, it often encourages a Marble
Imler to help it with easy physical tasks so that it does not feel different from its
kind.
