Like Gorgon Sorceresses, Witches have benefited from Rodia's lack of rules
restricting the use of magic. These Gorgons have managed to combine the
power of their gaze with that of Spell Gems, and they are able to utilize both at
once without difficulty. In their free time, they make copies of the magic books
borrowed from the Familiars, so they can return them and obtain new ones
completely free of charge.
