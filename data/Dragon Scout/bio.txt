Dragons that want a lair outside the Unsullied Meadows often choose a nest of
Arachnalisks to establish it, since these creatures do not care about their
treasures and even protect them from intruders.

The Dragon Scout never stays in the same place for long, as it likes to meet
other people and cultures, and acquire wisdom about the art of war through its
travels. There is not a single human, Elf, or Ent able to surprise one in battle,
so it is one of Rodia's most dangerous opponents.
