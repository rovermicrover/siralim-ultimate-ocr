An Efflorescent Ent's only task is to plant the flowers that grow on its trunk and
branches. After a few weeks, the buds grow and become adult cherry trees.
Any Ent except the Timeworn can bloom into an Efflorescent Ent, and it only
happens when a Springtime Aspect finds it necessary, in areas specially
harmed by humans or natural catastrophes. The Springtime Aspect has to
touch the Ent with its staff to trigger this unique transformation.
