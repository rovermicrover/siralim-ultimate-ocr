When William James told the dean of the Magic University of Ahruna about his

Like the Amorphous Shambler, the Recruiter can float in midair; and like the
Innocent, it tries to devour prey from time to time. On many occasions, they
simply gobble up birds or fish, who come out the other end of their jaws without
much difficulty. Others get caught between the ribs by accident and cannot get
out. This is how they first found the Benefactor, and in gratitude and laughter
they named this creature "Recruiter".
