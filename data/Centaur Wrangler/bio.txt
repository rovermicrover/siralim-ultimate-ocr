Like Duelists, their fighting style is not as rudimentary as that of the Warrior and
requires different skills. When a battle begins, Centaur Wranglers quickly
identify the most skilled warriors on the other side and disarm them with
precise snaps of their whips. They are in charge of keeping the rhythm of the
marches with cracks of their whips, to make sure the sleeping Centaurs keep
going in the same direction.
