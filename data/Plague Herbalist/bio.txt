Plague Herbalists have a prodigious knowledge about the effects of plants.
Indeed, the healers of other species learned many of their secrets from them.

Plague Herbalists detest rulers who use their position to gain wealth and power
at the expense of the lives of their subjects. After a great victory, the Herbalist
sneaks under the banquet table, where it splashes a special compound,
imbued with its own power, that discourages the sovereign, making them lose
their will to continue fighting.
