Krakens are grotesque, ruthless creatures who avoid approaching dry land at
all costs. Most of them live in the depths and do not poke their heads out of the
water very often, while the Abyssal Kraken never does. Other Krakens consider
it an absolute sovereign, and only under its command are they able to carry out
joint attacks. Although in ancient times their strategies overwhelmed the
Revenants, nowadays the Abyssal Kraken's main task is help as many
Krakens as possible to survive when one of their nests is discovered.
