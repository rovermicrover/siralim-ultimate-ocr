Predators in the forests of Hutika know that Luckmantrias are not easy prey,
and that trying to hunt them is a complete waste of time. The universe seems
to conspire in their favor, preventing them from being eaten is such creative
ways as the fortuitous fall of a tree or a sudden indigestion.

Winter is the Diamond Luckmantria's favorite season. The cold is not a
problem for it, and it hides between mounds of snow to rest for long periods of
time. If anyone were to discover its location, it is very likely that they will slip
and fall flat on the ground.
