The Satyrs built passages that connect the strongest trees to the underground
world, inhabited by the Inquisitors. To do this, they emptied the interior of these
trees and built ladders to allow easy access between the treetops and the
underground.

These creatures charge head on regardless of the size or strength of their
opponent, taking advantage of their horns. If a Satyr town suffers a massive
attack, they jump from the trees and plummet to the ground, sacrificing
themselves while taking several Ets with them.
