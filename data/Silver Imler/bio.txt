In their societies, Imlers work as miners and diggers. Along with the Imlings,
they establish their settlements in mountainous regions. The bonds between
them are strong, forged from a very young age, and it is rare to see an Imler
without an Imling partner.

The protuberances in the Silver Imler's shoulders sell at a high price in the
black market. Their Imling partners try to convince them to remove them so
that they are no longer a target for poachers.
