Although Wisps can appear anywhere, even in crowded squares filled with
market stalls, they never approach the temples of Surathli. Realizing this, a
young scientist who had been investigating these creatures had the idea of
pulverizing stones from the walls of one of the temples and tracing a wide
perimeter with the resulting pebbles. Indeed, no Wisps were able to get
through. Whether it is due to faith or the divine energy of this deity, Rodia must
now choose between defiling the temples of Surathli or remaining vulnerable in
the face of a terrible threat.

The Wisp Watcher appears as a flame that seeks to provide warmth to those
who need it on cold nights... until it opens its great eye and drives those who
look at it mad.
