Revenants live in warrior tribes in the depths of the oceans. A thousand years
ago they developed the necessary magic to live on the surface, and many
abandoned their home to earn a living as mercenaries.

Revenant Kings are often surrounded by a group of loyal protectors called
Cabalists. They identify and dismantle conspiracies that threaten the King,
generally through violence. In addition, they are skilled magic users who can
sacrifice their own vitality to cast multiple spells at once.
