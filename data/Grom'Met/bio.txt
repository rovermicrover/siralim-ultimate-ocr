When criminals started visiting the Amalgam Gardens, T'mere M'rgo decided
to create Grom'Met so he could help him give life to the creatures who would
defend his realm. He is very talkative and a prankster, and he gets along well
with the God of Fusion, although sometimes he can be too much for T'mere,
who asks him to shut up. He sometimes goes too far with his pranks as
wellâ€”for example, he once played dead after fighting a bunch of criminals.
T'mere knew perfectly well that he was alive, but did not find it amusing and
stopped talking to him for two weeks.
