Of all the Cockatrices that exist today, the Clawing Cockatrice has changed the
least compared to its common ancestor. It continues to inhabit temperate
forests and mountains where it can hunt relatively effortlessly. Its most notable
adaptation is its webbed tail, which allows it to swim and dive at high speeds,
making it easier for it to catch river fish, a staple of its current diet.
