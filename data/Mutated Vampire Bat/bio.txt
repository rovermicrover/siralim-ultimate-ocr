Just like standard Vampire Bats, they seem to be attracted to coins, though in
their case it is for a good reason. These intelligent creatures are literate, and
they often visit the marketplaces of towns and villages to buy food and books.
They usually live in abandoned houses near urban areas and earn their living
as messengers, although many of them prefer to simply attack travelers and
steal their money.
