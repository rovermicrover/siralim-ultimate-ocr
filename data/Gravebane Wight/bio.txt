Wights are native to the Kingdom of Heretics, but since King Misery rose up in
arms against Siralim, they have spread throughout the country to sow chaos.

The Gravebane Wight earned its name after a skirmish in the Valley of Herces,
located in the deepest part of the Unsullied Meadows, in which it destroyed the
mausoleum where the most famous warriors who gave their lives for the
unification of Rodia were buried.
