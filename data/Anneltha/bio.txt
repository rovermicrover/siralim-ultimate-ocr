A truly ancient being who has not been seen for milennia, precious little
knowledge has survived over the ages regarding Anneltha. Fragments of
ancient texts preserved in the libraries of Undolim, treated as unverified myth,
speak of a colossal worm Goddess who banished the sentient races of what is
now Radia from her realm for the crime of disrespecting the earth with their
greed. Only Aeolian has been known to speak of her, and then only reluctantly,
with noticeable sadness.

The recent machinations of Caliban have, however, unsealed her realm - and
Anneltha has not seen fit to re-seal it to outsiders once more. Few adventurers
have chanced the Forbidden Depths thus far, but reports of a crystalline hive
swarming with brutal monsters, as well as a few distant sightings of Anneltha
herself moving about the realm, suggest that these deep caves and their
inhabitants have not suffered for their isolation from the world.
