These creatures inhabit multiple lakes and rivers in Rodia, and feed mostly on
aquatic plants. However, they are able to survive on the surface, and in times
of drought they resort to feeding on shrubs and weeds. Bears and wolves see
Helios as potential prey when there is a lack of food, although it is not easy for
them to catch one. They are elusive and can feel the vibrations of footsteps
around them, so they almost always flee before any of these predators can
even approach.
