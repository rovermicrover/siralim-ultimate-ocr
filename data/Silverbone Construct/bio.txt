At present, some Constructs serve as labor for the heavier jobs such as
construction or mining. When the war against an old ruler of Siralim came to an
end, they became important assets in the reconstruction of the country.

When a Silverbone Construct meets an enemy, the eyes on its armor's skulls
shine with a ghostly blue flame. An eerie voice then emanates from within,
whispering continuously, until it suddenly explodes into a bloodcurdling scream.
This feature was added for frightening enemies, but in the end, it mainly served
as an alarm during attacks, and to scare civilians so they got to safety more
quickly.
