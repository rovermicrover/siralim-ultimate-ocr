The cry of this creature, native to the kingdom of Ercath, is one of the most
terrifying sounds that exists. Luckily, it hates crowds and never goes near
towns and cities, not even small villages. Their genetic memory is very
particular, since they remember all the threats to the life of any ancestor they
had before being conceived. Of course, capturing one of these creatures is
extremely difficult, as they know many tricks, as well as how to hide and where
it is better to lay low. However, their peculiar scream provokes interest in some
wealthy individuals, so there are often mercenaries trying to hunt them down
without much success.
