Zonte had a bad feeling about Vulcanar's intentions from the beginning. He had
dealt with the God before, and he knew it was no coincidence that he had
appeared with such an offer immediately after the Djinn uprising. Zonte twisted
his words to create the Frostfire Efreet. This creature's breath can freeze any
surface, and its touch can cause ice burns on the skin. Vulcanar had no choice
but to reluctantly exile this Efreet from the Great Pandemonium.
