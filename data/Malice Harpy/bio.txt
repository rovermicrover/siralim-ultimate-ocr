The Malice Harpy is a master of camouflage and concealment, and the one
who most often manages to sneak into towns and cities. Its tricks never seem
to end, from playing with the night shadows to sneaking in undetected, or even
hiding under carriages or among the merchandise, or wearing a hooded robe to
walk through the main gates during the day taking advantage of the crowd. For
this and other reasons, guards often check the caravans who want to enter,
and look carefully at the face of anyone who tries to conceal their identity.
