Only a few are aware that the Nihilists are the materialization of the very will of
the universe fighting to survive. Many intelligent creatures find their appearance
disturbing, yet animals are completely unaware of their presence.

The Nihilist Summoner's power is probably the most extraordinary. When a
Nihilist Seeker points out where someone has disappeared at the hands of a
Voidlord, this creature places its hand on its book and begins to chant. Ina
matter of minutes, every creature within a mile that had been erased from
existence will reappear as if nothing had happened.
