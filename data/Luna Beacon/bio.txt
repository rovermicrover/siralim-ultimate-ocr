Beacons reside in a forest where an intelligent species, now extinct, used to
live thousands of years ago. The trees are covered in paintings of vivid colors,
and even today they have not been deciphered.

On the battlefield, the Luna Beacon's flight becomes an unpredictable
whirlwind full of feints and sharp turns. It always uses the lower part of its body
to strike, which is hard as iron.
