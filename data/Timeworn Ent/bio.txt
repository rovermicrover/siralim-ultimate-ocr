Just like trees, Ents are not immune to parasites. When one of them becomes
infested, it progressively becomes a Timeworn Ent, and its life expectancy is
reduced to a few years. Aware of their limited time to help the forest, these
creatures exclusively hunt and kill humans no matter what they were doing in
the forest. A scientist from Vanelin discovered that they also lose their ability to
speak, so it is possible that their sanity is also affected.
