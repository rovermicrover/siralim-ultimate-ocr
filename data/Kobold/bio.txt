As with lizardmen, Kobolds are integrated into Rodian society and live in many
of its towns and all of its cities. However, unlike them, there are several
underground settlements exclusively inhabited by these creatures. Mining is
what the Kobolds who live in these places mostly do, but they are sadly often
attacked by creatures from the surface who want to seize the precious minerals
they extract. That is why all Kobolds living underground receive combat
training, even if they choose not to become miners.
