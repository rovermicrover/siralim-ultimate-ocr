Sirens do not always sing with the intention of harming others. However, many
of them inhabit the oceans, and make their homes near rocky elevations where
a ship could easily run aground.

The song of the Siren Beguiler evokes the feeling that great riches can be
found in the direction of the sound. Many sailors have learned to distinguish the
song, and they fire the cannons of their ships when they hear it to scare the
creatures away.
