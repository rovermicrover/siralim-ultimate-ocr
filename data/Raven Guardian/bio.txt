Crux the Eternal City was the cradle of the study of magic in the world. When
the Watcher War came to an end, the Ravens made the decision to lock the
Watcher Sentinel within its walls to make sure it did not cause any problems.
Since then, there always was a Raven guarding its prison... until an old ruler of
Siralim invaded the city and damaged the walls that contained the Sentinel,
who managed to escape. The current Guardian's mission is to find it, alive, and
return it to Crux.
