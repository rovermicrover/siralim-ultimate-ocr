But one day, he went too far. He decided that his mastery would not be
complete until he could separate the shadows themselves from their bodies. To
achieve his goal, he developed an item, a knife imbued with now-forbidden
magic. Blade in hand, he cut his own shadow, separating it from himself and
cutting off his soul and his sanity. His body fell to the ground, lifeless, and his
Shadow rose in a frenzy. A Shadow who could create other Shadows like itself.
A Shadow who could dominate them and call them to war. A Shadow that,
finally, was sealed away along with the army it had gathered.
