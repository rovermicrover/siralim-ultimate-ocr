William James was a famous pirate captain on the other side of the ocean; but
after being afflicted with a curse, he left for distant lands with all his fleet,
searching for the Mercury Cross, a legendary item able to put an end ta it.
Now, he and his crew are trying to amass a large enough fortune to rebuild the
ships they lost and sail anew. His favorite technique is to use his grappling
hook to pull his opponents closer and shoot them, kicking the lifeless body
when it is close enough.
