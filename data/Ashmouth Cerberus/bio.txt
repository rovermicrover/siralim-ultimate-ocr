The Cerberus species was created by Vulcanar to terrorize the inhabitants of
Rodia and protect the entrance to the Great Pandemonium.

When prey is not readily available, the Ashmouth Cerberus will sate its hunger
with any embers it can find around it. It is used to enduring temperatures above
200 Â°F, but it can survive in colder environments thanks to the thickness of its
skin and the heat it gives off due to its metabolism.
