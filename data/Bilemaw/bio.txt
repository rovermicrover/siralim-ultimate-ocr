This monster lives in a desert northeast of Rodia called the Bronze Sea, which
is four times bigger than the country and separates it from the other nations of
the continent. The Bilemaw has a tail with markings in the shape of eyes, and
when confronted by anather of these creatures for its territory, it stretches the
skin around these markings as much as possible. Whoever has the smallest
eyes will leave the area without violence. In the event of a tie, each one will dig
a tunnel of approximately one mile in length and then have a race to decide the
winer.
