It was thousands of years ago when Omelettes first encountered humans.
Specifically, they were integrated into the society of Kaito, where they let
humans paint them during their rituals of birth and death. When that civilization
came to an end, the Omelettes dispersed throughout the world and tried to
befriend humans from other places. Many of these Dumplings had to pay a
great price before they became more than food for the humans, but they are
now considered sacred creatures in Rodia and other regions of the world.
