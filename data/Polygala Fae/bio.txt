Inside Yataka lie the Fae Lands, a dimension inhabited by fairies and other
magical creatures. It's obviously much bigger on the inside than it is on the
outside, and nothing has come in or out in all of history so far

Although their wings are blue, the trace left behind by the Polygala Fae is
purple. These creatures can jump so high that they don't need to fly to move at
high speeds, especially if there is enough vegetation. For this reason, they also
find it easier to attack their enemies without being detected, since they do not
leave a trail behind them, and the sound of their wings flapping cannot be
heard.
