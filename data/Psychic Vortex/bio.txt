Vortices are not self-aware, but they have a natural instinct to protect the world
and to use their power to help their allies.

Time moves slower for the Psychic Vortex, which gives it time to read the
magical currents that are released before a spell is cast. This allows it to warn
its allies through a mental image of what is about to happen, giving them a
chance to avoid the spell.
