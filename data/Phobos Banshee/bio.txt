There is a common misconception in Radia that the Phobos Banshee feeds on
the fear of other creatures. This rumor was initially spread by a doctor in
Neralim after she realized how scared people were of the creature. When the
doctor's colleagues found out what she was doing, they started to imitate her,
and in a few years people went from running away from this Banshee to getting
close to her, feeling more relaxed thanks to the placebo effect.
