Whispering Shades are born from the death of those who deceive others to set
them against their true friends and allies. Unlike the other Shades, they do not
have any qualms about approaching small towns and villages, especially

during the night when everyone is asleep. Breathing the gas this creature
produces can cause delirium in those who are prone to distrust their friendships.
