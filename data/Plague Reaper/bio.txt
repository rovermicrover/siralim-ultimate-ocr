Sigmund took advantage of his friendship with a Bone Reaper to experiment on
it. Unbeknownst to the creature, he kept casting relatively innocuous curses on
it until it transformed into a Cursed Reaper. When it happened it demanded
explanations, but Sigmund locked it up and continued casting progressively
more powerful spells on it. It finally became a Plague Reaper, bound to him as
a slave. This creature brings misfortune wherever it goes, and touching its
scythe horribly curses its victim.
