When an Animation is brought to life, it will obey any command from its
creator, no matter what it is.

Even the quietest footsteps can be perceived by the Ear Animation, which is
why many necromancers use these creatures to watch their lairs. If they are
forced to strike physically, they will frantically spin and quickly get out of the
way to avoid receiving a counterattack.
