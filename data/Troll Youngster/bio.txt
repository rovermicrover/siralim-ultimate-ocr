Its harmless name has a certain irony. Although it is true that the Youngster is
not very old, it is the mast dangerous warrior of the mountain tribes. It became
famous thanks to a series of rumors. As they say, it has assaulted caravans on
its own, defeated a Thylacine and even confronted an Immortal King. On the
other hand, nobody has really seen the Youngster, so it is not known whether it
is just an unfounded legend or if there actually is a young and powerful Troll
capable of such feats.
