Beacons feed only on flowers, but are able to survive by eating just a few every
day. To maintain the forest's balance, they often plant trees and shrubs so that
other species are not affected by their presence. All beacons participate in this
activity, but the Rosy Beacon has the most important role in it, as it is the only
one who can create flowers with its power. In this way, it can help the bees with
pollination, or its own kind to feed themselves on a particularly rough year.
