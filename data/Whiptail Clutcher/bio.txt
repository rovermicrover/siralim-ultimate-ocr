When Taylor had been ruling for ten years, he began to care less about
carrying out his more than controversial activities in secret. In a display of
arrogance and indifference, he ordered the construction of a huge underground
complex on the outskirts of the city, which he called the Torture Chamber. He
created the Whiptail Clutcher to monitor the complex, as well as to inflict pain.
This creature digs its thick nails into the necks of its victims, then lashes them
with its tail repeatedly.
