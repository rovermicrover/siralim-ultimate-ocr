As Uraloses always produced everything they needed in their own lands, they
never had to consider trading with other peoples. It was not until the end of the

Formations are an important part of this speciesâ€™ battle style. Uralos
Spearmasters are always in the rear, protecting the most vulnerable fighters
from frontal charges or back attacks they did not fully expect.
