At some point in history, a small number of Gargoyles became self-aware.
According to Marette, the ones with the mast intricate patterns of action may
have developed a personality based on said patterns. The Stonehorn Gargoyle
has led this small group for centuries, watching over Undolim at night from the
top of the cathedral. When the city was invaded by an old ruler of Siralim, the
Stonehorn Gargoyle was defeated and had no choice but to flee.
