For a long time, Omnia was the most prosperous and beautiful city in the
world. A marvelous sight, which colors and architecture were beyond
imagination. High silver and glass towers, streets that ran at various heights,
lights that floated at night. From one day to another, it became a hotbed of
Ghouls and Forsaken, burnt and in ruins.

When a Rapturous Ghoul bites a victim, he does so while running, taking
advantage of his speed to tear off more tissue.
