Paragons are extremely long-lived and intelligent creatures that are integrated
into human society. They usually hold important positions as great merchants,
notaries or even advisors to the sovereigns of Rodia.

Diamond Paragons are especially interested in the fauna and flora of Rodia.
When the war ended, many of them joined teams of biologists in different cities
to study them. The University of Natural Science in Vanelin is currently directed
by one of them.
