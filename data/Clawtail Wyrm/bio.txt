In a very distant land lives a species of hominid dragons, who established their
reign there at the dawn of the world's history. They are powerful warriors, but of
simple ambitions, and have managed to repel attacks by armies of other
countries with resounding success, although given the extreme weather
conditions of their domains, they have never suffered a proper siege. However,
their strength resides in the creatures they host, tails that move independently,
but cooperatively. When a Clawtail Wyrm reaches adulthood, a ritual is
performed in which it is bound to one of these parasites for the rest of its life.
