This devilish pest enjoys torturing its victims with its own hands, generally
ripping them open to eat their guts while they are still alive. It considers the
bloodstains on its body lucky charms and never cleans them up, even if it is its
own blood. That is why the scent of a Feral Carver is so characteristic, to the
point of serving as a warning to many adventurers when they are near one of
their lairs.
