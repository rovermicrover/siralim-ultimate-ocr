The Amaranths guided the first humans in the use of magic. However, as they
witnessed their selfishness and ambition, they stopped associating with them.
On one occasion, Helmholtz made a deep incision to a living Amaranth and
found that it was completely empty inside.

Regardless of the force with which a Planetary Amaranth is hit, it is never
knocked back. They are commonly seen after a bloody battle, observing those
who tend to the wounded.
