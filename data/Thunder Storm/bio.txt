During rainy days, Storms get really angry and leave their mastersâ€™ houses or
search for clearings in the jungle. With their eyes fixed on the clouds and their
faces full of rage, these creatures begin to emit thunder and rain as if it were a
competition.

The Thunder Storm is loyal to its companions, and it only unleashes the
precise amount of electricity that it needs, to the point where it can revive a
creature whose heart has stopped.
