Some Nixes are integrated into human society. Many work as hired killers due
to their renowned agility, stealth, and skill with knives.

When someone hires the services of a Nix Scoundrel, it is very clear that the
target is going to suffer before dying. These creatures are bloodthirsty
murderers who are experts in torture, and experts in leaving gruesome crime
scenes. They usually also murder the target's family in front of their eyes.
