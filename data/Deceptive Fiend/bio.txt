The Deceptive Fiend was one of Vulcanar's pets for a long time. Gifted with
intelligence, it hated its master for treating it like a common beast. When the
God of Fire exiled the Fiends, it hid among them and escaped the Great
Pandemonium. It saw that mortals also treated creatures as slaves, and it
decided to devote its life to freeing as many beasts as it could from the yoke of
their masters, regardless of whether they were trained animals, pets or faithful
companions.
