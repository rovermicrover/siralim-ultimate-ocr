It is a common misconception that the power of the Basilisks is contained in
their eyeballs. A study carried out in the Refuge of the Magi confirmed that their
powers still worked after removing their eyes.

The Dormant Basilisk has great regenerative abilities: even if they lose their tail
or an arm, they grow back in a matter of seconds. Potions that contain hair of
this creature are commonly sold on the black market. The most frequent effect
after ingesting these products is acute diarrhea.
