The Skeleton Triggerman is the most swashbuckling of its kind. It likes to sneak
into big cities, go into taverns of lesser repute and shoot up the place for fun.
Thanks to its reckless behavior, the main weakness of its species was quickly
discovered: the only way to defeat them for good is to damage their skulls. It
also seems to like drinking whiskey, though it spills on the floor through the
cavity of its throat.
