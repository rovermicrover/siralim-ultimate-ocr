The tail of a Sparktail is charged with electricity. They use it as a weapon to
defend themselved if they are in trouble, but also for other tasks. For example,
Sparktail Officers can use it to shoot red and blue beams of electricity.
Although they only cause a slight tingling sensation, they can be used to signal
there is an emergency while moving through the air with a grim face.
