Tartarith did not even introduce himself. When the seven adventurers stopped
at a crossroads, the God of Punishment came out of the shadows and stabbed
them before they had time to react. For their insolence, he decided to torture
them personally, destroy their humanity and turn them into Masochists. The
Angler was once the leader of the group, an agile warrior native of Ahruna who
wielded two katars. Tartarith liked the exotic weapons and replaced the arms of
the entire group with similar ones.
