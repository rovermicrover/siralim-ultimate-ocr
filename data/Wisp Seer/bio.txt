Wisp Seers are the most mysterious of their kind, as well as the most
dangerous. Most of the time they remain motionless, as if inviting those meet
them to look inside their flames. In addition to showing those who stare at them
their final moments, they also increase their emotional sensitivity before
bringing out their deepest fears. Since they first appeared, there have been
hundreds of new cases of severe mental trauma, as well as numerous deaths,
which has put the Council of Radia in a tight spot.
