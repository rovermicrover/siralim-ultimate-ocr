In order to create the Pit Wraiths, Vertraag did not spend a single drop of his
power. Instead, he created gravitational waves in his dimension, which caused
the Pit Wraiths to appear one by one in Eternity's End.

The Pit Wraith Liberator produces a temporal wave with its wings that slows
down its enemiesâ€™ movements. However, it is not very accurate, and it usually
misses if the target is moving around the battlefield.
