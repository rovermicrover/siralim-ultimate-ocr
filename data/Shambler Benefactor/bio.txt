James's pirates once went underwater to visit small Revenant settlements. In
one of their temples, they found engravings of creatures none of them had ever
seen before. According to Revenant culture, it was an intelligent species who
inhabited the Boreal Ocean and went extinct thousands of years ago. Their
knowledge of magic rivaled that of the Ravens, and they tried to rule over the
depths until, one day, they suddenly stopped attacking the Revenants.

The Shambler Benefactor is all that is left of that species, and it has lost all
vestige of its former intelligence. James's pirates jokingly decided to name it
Benefactor, as they never would have become undead had it not been for its
curse.
