The main reason why the Unsullied Meadows remain unsullied are the
Dragons. Together with other creatures, they prevent everyone from destroying
or permanently settling in that beautiful place.

Dragon Guardians protect the clutches and are the least merciful to intruders.
They know all the tricks after all the years they have been doing their job.
Sometimes they let the poachers believe they are safe, only to ram them with
the steely scales of their foreheads when they lower their guard.
