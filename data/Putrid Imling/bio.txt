In their societies, one Imler and one Imling rule together over the others.
However, as Imlings are more intelligent, they make all of the decisions and let
the Imlers believe they are being a great help.

The mutant-like appearance of the Putrid Imling is actually to its advantage. It
is the only one of its species able to dive for hours without needing to breathe,
which allows it to easily search for food and treasure in lakes, rivers and
swamps.
