The Beacons are fairies that protect a forest located in between four mountains
to the north of Siralim, making it difficult to access.

The wings of the Atlas Beacon are always engulfed in flames. However, the fire
this creature produces does not affect the fauna and flora of its habitat at all.
When it attacks, it spins on itself, turning into a deadly whirlwind of fire.
