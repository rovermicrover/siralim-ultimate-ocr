During the cold season, the Waspids of Rodia leave their colonies due to food
shortages, and establish new ones west of Undolim, near the Barrens. This is a
crucial stage because, unlike wasps, Waspid queens do not have the ability to
hibernate. The Waspid Scout is in charge of finding an ideal place to build the
new hive. When winter approaches, the queen feeds a mixture of hormones to
one of the larvae so that it develops as a Waspid Scout.
