Manticores have an insatiable appetite for human flesh. Even after a feast,
these creatures go in search of new prey to feed on.

The Martyaxwar is a unique creature. Its long fangs can pierce metal and crush
rock. It can also cast spells through its jaws that momentarily fracture space,
allowing it to bite its victim from a safe distance.
