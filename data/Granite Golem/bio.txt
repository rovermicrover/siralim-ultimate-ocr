Granite Golems hate Magi and everything related to them. Even though they
are quite loyal to their masters, it can be dangerous for a Mage to own one, as
their instincts can provoke the occasional outburst that usually results in
property damage. On the other hand, whenever a magical accident causes
damage to a town, this creature always appears to help rebuild it.
