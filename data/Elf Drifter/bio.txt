Broca the Drifter is a legendary warrior who left his village centuries ago to lead
a solitary life. He is the oldest Elf currently alive and as he himself affirmed, the
most bored with life in the forest. In his time, he was at once the most skillful
Huntsman and Rogue, and over time he developed his own style. One of his
exploits as The Drifter was to find the entrance to the town of the Centaurs,
although he did not participate in the attack as he disagreed with the orders to
annihilate them.
