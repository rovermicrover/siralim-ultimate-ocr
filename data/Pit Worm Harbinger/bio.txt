Pit Worms can eat almost anything, especially if it has a heart beating inside. If
they are properly trained and fed from a young age, they are easy to tame and
likely to become obedient creatures.

The Pit Worm Harbinger is perhaps the most intelligent of its kind. When it
finds prey, it does not attack directly, instead digging around it and modifying
the terrain to hinder its movement.
