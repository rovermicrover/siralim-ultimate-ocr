The Path of the Damned was once known as Arcadia, a sunny green paradise
ruled by the Goddess of Peace. The Banshees, who emerged from remains of
the previous God of Darkness, were the first to populate the realm after it was
invaded by darkness and death.

Although they cannot speak or think like intelligent beings, Banshees can
establish bonds with other creatures. The screams of a Styx Banshee interfere
with their enemiesâ€™ spellcasting.
