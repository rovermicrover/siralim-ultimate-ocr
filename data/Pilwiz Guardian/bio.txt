A considerable part of Radia's crops belongs to the Pilwiz. Despite being
farmers, the dangers of outdoor life in the country have forced these creatures
to learn how to defend themselves properly.

Pilwiz Guardians drive away any herbivorous animals and pests that try to feed
on the fruits of their labor during the day. When faced with dangerous
creatures, they lick the blood left in their scythes to heal their own wounds.
