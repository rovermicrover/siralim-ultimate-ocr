During a storm, the Unicorn Thundercracker runs electricity through its horn to
attract lightning to it just for fun. Its coat bristles when struck by lightning, and it
apparently feels a very pleasant tingling. The authorities of Rodia strongly
recommend not approaching them under these circumstances, especially
when they are in a drove, as it can easily become a competition.
