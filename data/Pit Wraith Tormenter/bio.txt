When Taylor decided to kill his father instead of forgiving him for abandoning
him, accidentally turning him into a God, a Pit Wraith fed on what he never

at each other for a moment, but before the God could think of killing it, it
unfolded before his eyes. The mere presence of this creature arouses vivid
images of a happy future in those who abandoned their loved ones, plunging
them into a deep sadness.
