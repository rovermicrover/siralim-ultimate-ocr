Cautious and observant, the Mite Interloper waits for nightfall to act. It sneaks
into cities through the sewers, and from there it tries to enter large food
warehouses to eat the leftovers. If it is not hungry, it follows its nose to magic
item shops, since it likes to collect such devices, probably because of their
smell. Even so, it hardly ever succeeds, as the numerous thefts have forced
the inhabitants of Rodia to reinforce their businesses" security and use traps.
