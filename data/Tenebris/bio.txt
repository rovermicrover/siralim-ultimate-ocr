River was a powerful Magi who studied in the Refuge of the Magi. There, he
formed a great friendship with another student named Hexilo. After a few years,
his friend began to develop an affinity for the dark arts, and later, when River
left the Refuge of the Magi, he began to hear stories of a necromancer who
terrorized a kingdom near Siralim, beyond the lands that would be known as
Rodia a few centuries later. Convinced it was his old friend, River traveled to
that kingdom and found that he was right. For several years they fought each
other until both of them joined the Auditors. Together with four other agents
they formed the Enclave of Six, and River led the group. The six Magi carried
out many missions throughout the world. Following the incident in the Refuge
of the Magi, River transformed into Tenebris. He soon found that using divine
power was not much different from using magic, something that neither
Apocranox nor Venedon had done up to that very moment. Using each other's
power he helped them create their own realms. He later created the Bastion of
the Void together with Mortem, and, after saying goodbye to his friends, he left
this world.
