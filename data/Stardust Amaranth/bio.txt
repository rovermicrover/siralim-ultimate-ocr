Amaranths seem to be exempt from the laws of the universe, as their powers
are above them. When they move, it looks like space is moving around them
instead.

The Stardust Amaranth emits a constant tinkle and shines with a soft, subdued
light that illuminated everything around it. To attack physically, this creature
does not have to move or be in direct contact with its enemy. The blow simply
happens.
