When humans and creatures populated the land, the first cities were born. But
it seemed like the children of the Gods would forever fight among themselves.

Priests are venerated as divine creatures in all of the kingdoms of Rodia.
Forests and their ecosystems have been affected by wars and other human
activities. The Forest Priests traveled to these places and spread their essence
to repopulate them. When they finished their work, some stayed behind to
prevent that from happening again.
