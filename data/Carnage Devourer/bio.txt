This creature is extremely intelligent, but despite its fierce appearance, it does
not have the unquenchable thirst for blood typical of its species. From a ruined
temple, the Devourer watched its allies fight each other. It quickly descended
and approached them, avoiding energy rays, spells and stomps. It climbed the
Mystical Giant's leg and jumped to its throat, making it howl and stop. The
Corox waited cautiously. Then, the Devourer turned to the Observer, who
wanted to "tell" them something.
