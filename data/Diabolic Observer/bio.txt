This one-eyed creature specializes in battlefield analysis and threat detection.
In order to keep its voice in shape so that its warnings in battle are loud and
clear, it devotes part of its free time to singing songs about the beauty of nature
that are not fully appreciated by his comrades-in-arms of the Diabolic Horde.
