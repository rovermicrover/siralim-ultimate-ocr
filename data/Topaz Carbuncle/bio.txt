Carbuncles can only feed on ambient magic, and they do it through the gem on
their foreheads. If it is removed, they starve to death a few days later. Whether
it was for fun or part of his plans, Vertraag revealed certain secrets to the

Topaz Carbuncles are tame and spend most of the day asleep. In addition,
they are the ones that most easily establish links with creatures of other
species, so it is very common to find them as pets in non-human towns and
cities, especially Crux.
