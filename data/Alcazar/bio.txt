AA Bastion that gives shelter to a person with royal blood becomes an Alcazar,
even if that person was an illegitimate child. This was discovered in the years
after the unification of Rodia by a famous scientist from a noble family who
studied Bastions for a long time. After several weeks of research, he went
inside a Bastion and the transformation happened. He replicated his
experiment seven times before formulating his hypothesis, although he did not
know whether this phenomenon can be triggered in other ways.
