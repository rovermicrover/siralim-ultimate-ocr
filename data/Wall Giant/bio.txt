As the size of Giants and other creatures makes it impossible to take them
through the streets or inside buildings, Magi had to come up with a spell to
shrink any creature to a more reasonable size. The spell has many restrictions
and only works with creatures that have a bond with the caster, so it is not
suitable for battle.
