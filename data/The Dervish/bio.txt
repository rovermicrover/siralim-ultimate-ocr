According to legend, there is a plain deep in the Unsullied Meadows, guarded
by creatures called Dervish. This is said to have been the first piece of land that
Aeolian shaped, or at least the first piece of land he was satisfied with. It is said
to be a very precious place for this God, and sometimes he even rests there.
Every time Aeolian lands on the cool grass of this plain, a hundred Dervish
each take shape from a blade of grass around him.
