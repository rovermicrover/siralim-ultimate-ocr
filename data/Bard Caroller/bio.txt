Many artists dedicate their lives to performing for the general public during
festivities. This forces them to keep traveling throughout the year, but they
return to their place of origin for the winter festival that commemorates the
victory against the Watchers. There they sing and dance with their relatives and
childhood friends, strengthening the bonds that unite them. When these artists
die during this period, a Bard Caroller is sometimes created. This creature's
music brings out existing emotions and positive thoughts, and it can even make
two people who hate each other hug.
