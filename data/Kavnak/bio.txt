Akimo Forest is riddled with curses due to a bloody battle that occurred there
during the Unification War. To contain the magic in that place, Milner and other
Magi performed a complex ritual that sealed all these curses within the trees.
At night, the shape of a face appears on the trunks, then emerges from the
bark to wander around, floating through the thick vegetation. They are not
aggressive creatures, and they do not need to feed, but they will respond with
full force to any attack.
