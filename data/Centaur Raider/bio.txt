Wernicke the Raider is the most powerful Centaur warrior. Two hundred years
ago, when the Elves managed to find a way into his village, he tried to protect
his people armed only with a thick branch, but he was killed by the arrows of
his enemies. When everything seemed lost, his heart began to beat once again
in his chest. He had become Gonfurian's Chosen. Overflowing with new life,
and alone, he managed to contain the invaders until the other warriors came to
his aid.
