Electricity is beginning to be used in some countries on the continent where
Rodia is located, though there is still a long way to go. Indeed, magic is
involved in most of the research on this matter. It can be said that the
Proxigeist was a failed experiment, since the ritual that was supposed to
amplify the electrical power of some batteries ended up linking them to a ghost
that was nearby.
