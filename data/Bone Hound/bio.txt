On full moon nights, a howl can be heard. The sound of its voice is hollow, as if
the wind blew inside empty, lifeless spaces. The villagers barricade their doors
and windows. The Bone Hound has arrived. It is believed that its existence is
linked to humans, having come alive at some point to punish them for their
insolence. Followed by a pack as hungry for revenge as it is, the Bone Hound
bites and tears like the rest of its siblings. However, its fangs inflict wounds that
never heal.
