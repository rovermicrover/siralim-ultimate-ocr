This creature, also known as the dreamwalking pup, serves Caliban's purposes
as his loyal companion, according to those who have managed to survive its
attack. As Caliban normally cannot manifest in reality, he uses Colg to take
down whoever refuses to fulfill his designs. Fortunately, if one succeeds in
destroying this creature, Caliban will be unable to enter their dreams from then
on.
