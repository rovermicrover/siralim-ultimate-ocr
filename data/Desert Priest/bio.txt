Yseros knew that the peace brought on by the Priests was just an illusion. Still,
she decided that at least one kingdom would never know war. With Lister's
help, she created the Desert Priest, an immortal creature that would rule over a
new nation. It traveled the world and gathered the homeless. Years later, it led
them to a large oasis between the Barrens and the Faraway Enclave in western
Rodia. There, humans and creatures founded a new nation, which they called
Ahruna.
