Marette, the dean of the Magic University of Undolim, researched for decades
to find a way to give life to inanimate oktjects. Her prcject finally succeeded a
few years before the Unification War began.

The Magi of Undolim gave the Goretongue Gargoyle its name because of its
extraordinary ability. This creature has an exceptional control over magic: as
long as there is blood on its tongue, it is able to cast spells indefinitely.
