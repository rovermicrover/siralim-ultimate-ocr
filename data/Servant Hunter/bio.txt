Sometimes, a group of Hunters is defeated by other creatures or by the ruler of
a kingdom on their way to conquer all of Radia. If one of them survives, it will
look for another group of Hunters to join so that it can be among its own and
survive. However, when this happens, it becomes the lowest in the hierarchy of
the group and must obey every order it receives.
