The Springtime Aspect emerges from the hills when they are covered in
flowers, rising heavily and shaking the dirt from its mossy fur. Its body is home
to insects and small birds, and bees often visit the flowers that grow on its arms
and head. Its very presence helps the flowers bloom in the most arid regions
and its cane punishes those who exploit the land.
