Both Imlers and Imlings belong to the same species, but this was only
discovered recently due to the considerable differences between the two.

Imlers develop protective feelings towards Imlings and do not let them come to
harm. Indeed, when a Boulder Imler egg is born as a Tainted Imling, its partner
takes care of it at all times despite its unbearable odor, embracing it at night
even though doing so leaves the Imler with severe skin injuries.
