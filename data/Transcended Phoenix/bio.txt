When a Phoenix has been reborn forty-two times, it becomes a Transcended
Phoenix. This creature never gets old or sick, but it cannot regenerate, so steel
and magic can end its life. Females gain the ability to lay an unlimited number
of eggs, although their offspring is always of the father's subspecies. The
number of Phoenixes was considerably reduced in the Unification War. To
repopulate the species, Helmholtz and Milner searched for two Transcended
Phoenixes, a male and a female.
