In Radia, these creatures inhabit mainly snowy mountains and frozen places in
Azural's realm. This fact, coupled with their appearance, has led people to
believe their plumages evolved so they could camouflage themselves in their
environment and to protect them from the cold. However, Cockatrices with very
similar morphology but brown plumages also inhabit desertic regions in other
countries. A group of biologists from Andolin discovered not only that these
birds are identical, capable of withstanding extreme temperatures both high
and low, but also that their plumages change color in the following molt if their
environment changes.
