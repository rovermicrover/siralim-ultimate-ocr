This creature lives mainly in rocky valleys and is an expert climber, as well as a
relentless predator. When it sees a goat trying to climb or descend the
mountain, it quickly moves towards it and headbutts it to make it fall. The color
of its exoskeleton allows it to blend in with its surroundings, but if it moves
carelessly, it can fall prey to large birds, so it remains motionless most of the
time.
